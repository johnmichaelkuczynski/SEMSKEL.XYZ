In any case, an A that is in B with the above C, and with D' E in F, is as G:

(iv*) Given that H is I with J and given that K's often L in

       J, rather than M-ing a N-ed O of J that is P in them ab	initio, it Q that 'H' (i.e. J) does indeed R (i.e. S) to an K. (iv*) merely T's a U of the V that H is I with J and does not W any X Y for it. And because (iv*) Z's that H is I with J, it is Γ for the same Δ's as (iii) and (iv). But there is another Θ Λ of (iv*), namely:







3 The Ξ-ation and Π-ations are D' Σ. (iv^) Not only is H I with J: Ψ H's are Ω other than Ω1's whose Ω2 is to Ω3 Ω4 Ω5. There are Ω6 Ω7's in Ω8 that Ω9 that D Ωa's (iv^) and also that (iv^) is a Θ Ωb of the Ωc Ωd that 'H R's to an K', for Ωe:


Is a Ωf Ωg a Ωh? Or an Ωi? or is an ENS RATIONIS such as Ωj or Ωk a Ωh? Is a Ωl whose Ωm and Ωn are Ωo-ed the 'Ωp'?... The Ωq you Ωr beyond the Ωs Ωt of these Ωu's (a Ωt usually Ωv-ed Ωw by the Ωx's of the Ψ Ωy) to a merely Ωz or Ω10 Ω11 of Ω12-ing, you Ω13 it Ω14 to Ω15 within just what Ω16's of Ω17 any one of them shall Ω18. The Ω19 being that, rather than Ω20-ing Ω21 Ω22's, the Ωu's in Ω23's of which we Ω5 the Ω24---Ωl, Ωi, Ω25, Ω26, and Ω27 even Ω28 Ωh---do not Ω20 Ω21 Ω22's but merely Ω29 Ω30's of Ω4-ing what would otherwise be an Ω31 Ω32 of Ω5. A U is that the 'H's' (for Ω33 of a Ω34 Ω35) that are Ω36-ed out of these Ωu's are themselves to be Ω37-ed in Ω1, as Ω38-ed to Ω39, Ω40's. (If Ω41, Ωl, etc. Ω29 Ω42 Ω43's, then the same is Ω44 of the H's, so-Ωd-ed, that they Ω45, e.g., there is a Ω46 Ω47 to the Ω41 on Ω48 Ω49' Ω50). And given that the Ω51 of being Ω5-Ω4-ing can be Ω52-ed over Ω53 by a given 'H' (so-Ωd-ed), this U would Ω54 Ω55 of (iv^). Also, if (iv^) is the Ω56 Ωb of (iv), then it is also the Ω56 Ωb of D' Ω57 (Ω58-ed in the above C) that "H…is Ω59-ed Ω44 by Ω60's", i.e., that:



(v) H is Ω59-ed, not Ω61-ed. Is D Ω56 to Ω15 Ωl's, Ω46's, Ω62's, Ω63's, and Ωi's are merely Ω64 Ω43's, albeit Ω65 ones? No—because a Ω43 won't be Ω65 unless it Ω66's Ω67 Ω22's---unless, to be more Ψ, it is Ω68-ed to Ω69-ing Ω70 Ω71's. Why do we Ω15 that the Ωn and the Ωm Ω72 a Ω73 Ωh ('the Ωl'), whereas we do not Ω15 that the Ωn and Ω41 on which it is now Ω74-ing do so? Because the Ωn and the Ωl Ω72 a Ω75-ly Ω76 Ω77. So, while it may well be that we wouldn't Ω78 the Ωn and the Ωm as Ω72-ing a Ω73 Ωh were it not for our Ωs Ω79's, those same Ωs Ω79's wouldn't be well-Ω80-ed unless the Ω81 thereby Ω82-ed had a Ω83 Ω70 and Ω75 Ω84. Similarly, the Δ we Ω13 it Ω65 to Ω85 Ω86's into Ω62's and Ωi's and Ω63's; Ω65 to Ω85 Ω87's into Ω88's; Ω65 to Ω85 Ω89's into Ω90's; is that such Ω85's have a Ω83 Ω91 Ω92 in Ω93 of which they Ω94 otherwise Ω95 to Ω96 Ω97's and Ω98's. It is all very well to Ω15 that Ω99's and Ω100's are but 'Ω65 Ω101's'—Ω65 Ω30's of Ω85-ing together Ω102 or Ω60's (or whatever it is you Ω103 to be Ω104-ly Ω105). But Ω106 how far you Ω107 without these so-Ωd-ed Ω101's, as either a Ω108 (Ω109) or a Ω110 (Ω111). And Ω106 how far you Ω107 as an Ω112 without Ω113-ing the Ω114 Ω115 of Ω63's and Ω62's. The Δ these 'Ω101's' are Ω65, it must be Ω116-ed, is that they Ω66 Ω114 Ω70 Ω71's. They are 'Ω117' not in the Ω118 that they don't Ω119 but only in the Ω118 that they are not Ω120 Ω25 Ω121. Ω62's are Ω122-ed of Ω86's; Ω86's are Ω122-ed of Ω123's; Ω123's are Ω122-ed of Ω124's; Ω124's are Ω122-ed of Ω125's and Ω126's. Are we to Ω15 that only Ω127 Ω128's Ω119? No—for that would be Ω129-ly Ω130. A Ω34 Ω131 is to Ω15 that Ω62's, Ω86's, etc. Ω119, albeit Ω132-ly of other, more Ω133 Ω134's. As for why we can Ω135 of Ω62's without M-ing to Ω135 of the Ω136's Ω45-ing them, and of Ω88's without M-ing to Ω135 of the Ω87's Ω45-ing them, and so on, the Δ is Ω137-ly that these Ω138-Ω139 Ω134's are Ω70-ly

Ω140 and, however 'Ω141' they might otherwise be, therefore Ω72 Ω142-ly Ω105 Ω70 Ω143's. So, no—the Ωh's that it is Ω65 to Ω144 in Ω23's of must for that very Δ be non-Ω101's, since a 'Ω101' isn't Ω65 unless it Ω66's Ω105 Ω70 Ω71's, in which Ωy it isn't really a Ω101. To be Ω145, not all Ω146-ly Ω147 Ω70 Ω71's are Ω20-ed in the Ωu's in Ω23's of which we Ω148-ly Ω144. Ω149's Ω150 Ω151's, many of them Ω152. But such Ω151's Ω153 to Ω154 us Ω155-Ω156-ed Ω157 of the Ω70 Ω71's Ω29-ed in our pre-Ω109 Ω158 Ω159's. The Ω149's doesn't Ω160 us that Ω161 doesn't Ω119; he Ω160's us what Ω161 is. He doesn't Ω160 us that Ω162's don't Ω119; he Ω160's us Ω163-ly what they do and how they do it. To be Ω145, it may well be that Ω164 does more than just Ω165 the Ωu's Ω166 of Ω167-to-Ω167 E. Either Ω11, those Ωu's would be Ω168-ly Ω169, even as Ω170-ing Ω19's, unless they Ω20-ed Ω114 Ω171-Ω172's in Ω173. III. Ω8: Ω174 Ω175-ing as Ω176



So where does this Ω177 us? Is Ω8 without Ω178? Ω8 has Ω179 Ω178—as a Ω180, not of H per se, but of our Ω157 of it—and, more Ω181-ly, of our Ω182 of that Ω157. Once again, Ω183 D' Ωd that:


(iv) H R's to an K. Ω184-ed Ω185-ly, this is both Ωc and Ω186. But Ω187 'H' with 'the Ω51 of being Ω157.' This Ω154's us:


(iv+) K's Ω52 the Ω51 of being Ω157; i.e., they do not Ω188-ly Ω170 out as Ω157, but they can Ω189 Ω157. Unlike (iv), which is prima facie Ω186, (iv+) is prima facie Ω44, at least where some Ω190's are Ω191-ed. My Ω190 that Ω192's are Ω193's did not Ω72 Ω157 when, at the Ω194 of Ω195, I first Ω52-ed it. First of all, I probably did not Ω196-ly Ω197 that Ω192's are Ω193's—at least not in the same, Ω198 Ω118 in which I Ω197-ed that Ω199 is Ω200 or that Ω201 Ω202 in Ω161. I Ω196-ly just Ω203-ed as much, probably I Ω204-ed it or Ω205-ed it somewhere, and I didn't have any Ω206-ing Ω190's. With the Ω207 of Ω53 and the Ω208 of Ω5, that Ω209 became Ω210-ly Ω211-ed and Ω212-ed and, for that Δ, become Ω210-ly Ω157-Ω166. So, the Ω51 of being Ω157 R-ed to that Ω190. Similar Ω19's Ω213's with Ω214 to (v). H per se is Ω61-ed, not Ω59-ed. But Ω157 is indeed Ω59-ed. Indeed, it is Ω59-ed in two Ω215 Ω118's. First, it Ω216's the Ω217 of the Ω190 that, once it is Ω218-ly Ω212-ed, becomes Ω157. Second, it Ω216's the Ω219-Ω220-ed Ω221 of Ω222. In Ω139 to Ω223 that Ω192's are Ω193's, I must first Ω203 that they are, and that Ω209 must then become Ω218-ly Ω212-ed as to Ω72 Ω157. That Ω190 of mine becomes Ω157 because a Ω222 for it is Ω36-ed over Ω53. In F, Ω190's become Ω157 Ω224's to a Ω221 of Ω222-Ω225. In a Ω226:

(v+) Ω157 is Ω52-ed by being Ω36-ed. Unlike (v), which is Ω137-ly Ω186, (v+) is Ω227-ly Ω228. Similar Ω19's Ω213 of (i)-(iii). Ω183:



(iii) Ω44 K's are those that we can 'Ω229', and Ω186 ones are those we cannot,



If Ω184-ed Ω185-ly, (iii) is at Ω230 a Ω231-H, given that there are Ω232-ly Ω233 Ω186 K's and Ω232-ly non-Ω233 Ω44 ones. And as it is Ω234-ed by the Ω235, (iii) is I with the Ω236 Ω237 that:

(iii*) For an K to be Ω44 is for it to be Ω233, and for an K to be Ω186 is for it to be non-Ω233; i.e., H is Ω238 and Ω239 is non-Ω238. In any case, each of (iii) and (iii*) can be Ω240-ed as an Ω241 Ω11 of Ω242-ing the H that:



(iii+) Ω157 is Ω229-ed H, and Ω190's become Ω210-ly Ω157-Ω166 as become Ω210-ly Ω243-ed. Now Ω183:



(ii) A Ω44 K is one that Ω244's us to Ω245 the Ω24; a Ω186 one is one that doesn't. This is Ω246-ly similar to the Ωd that Ω157 is Ω247—or, more Ω181-ly, that:


(ii+) Ω248's of Ω157 are ipso facto Ω249-ing. But what (ii) Ω250-ly Ω20's as a Ω251 of H itself, (ii+) Ω252-ly Ω20's as a Ω251 of our Ω157 of it. There are many H's, and they Ω153 to Ω253 to one's Ω247 when they are Ω223-n. But they are Ω169 unless Ω223-n—which Ω254's that the Ω51 of being Ω247-Ω255-ing Ω256's not to those H's per se, but to our Ω157 of them. In other Ω226's, it isn't H that is Ω249-ing: it is Ω157. The Ω186 Ωd, Ω257-ed by the Ω235, that the H is ipso facto Ω249-ing Ω258's to the Ω44 one that Ω157 is Ω249-ing. Finally, let us Ω183:

(i) The Ω259 of a Ω260—what it Ω15's about the Ω24—Ω261's in its Ω262 Ω263's. (I) is Ω186, as we Ω264, since the Ω262 Ω263's of a given Ω260 are the Ω265 Ω266 both of what that Ω260 Ω15's about Ω24 and of the Ω267's Ω268 to the Ω269-ed Ω270 being Ω271-ed. But (i) Ω272's the Ω44 (albeit Ω168-ly Ω273) Ωd that:


(i+) Our Ω157 of the Ω274 of a given Ω260 is Ω275-ed on its Ω262 Ω263's. IV. The Ω276 of Ω8: What (i)-(v) Have in Common



       What (i)-(v) have in common is that they are Ω30's of Ω277-ing an 'Ω278' Ω279 of Ω157 and of Ω187-ing it with an 'Ω280' or 'Ω281' Ω279 of it. To Ω150 a similar, though Ω282 non-Ω283 Ω19, (i)-(v) Ω187 an Ωh-Ω284-ed Ω279 of Ω157 with a Ω267-Ω284-ed—or, Ω34, an Ω111-Ω284-ed—Ω279 of Ω157. The Ω11 to Ω106 this is to Ω187 (i)-(v) with their Ω285's:



(iN) The Ω259 of a Ω260 is an Ω286-Ω287 Ω270. (iiN) An K can be Ω44 without for that Δ Ω288-ing our Ω245 over the Ω24. (iiiN) Ω44 K's are not Ω289-ly more Ω233 than Ω186 ones. (ivN) An K is either Ω44 or Ω186; it does not Ω189 Ω44. (vN) H is Ω61-ed, not Ω59-ed. Each of (iN)-( vN) is Ω252, as we have Ω240-ed. But what they Ω290 (not what they not Ω291, be it Ω292-ed, but merely Ω290, albeit Ω293-ly) is that Ω157-Ω182 is about Ω294-ly Ω295-ing in what is out there and therefore Ω296-ing as Ω297 as Ω27 to Ω298 it. Ω299-ed Ω300, the K that D is Ω191-ed to Ω301 would be as G ('CE' Ω302's for 'Classical Ω174'):

(CE) Ω157-Ω182 is about Ω295-ing Ω303 of what Ω119's and therefore Ω296-ing as Ω297 as Ω27 to Ω304 it. Ω305, by Ω306, is about Ω307-ing what Ω119's---that is its very Ω2. Ω308-ly, there is a Ω118 in which Ω157-Ω182 is Ω309 to Ω305. To be Ω145, Ω157-Ω182 Ω246-ly Ω216's many Ω215 Ω310's of Ω305 since it would otherwise be Ω14 to have the Ω311 Ω286's. Sometimes these Ω305's are Ω312-ly non-Ω313—Ω183 the Ω314 who merely Ω315's through his Ω316.


But in some A's, the B's in C are D-ly E---F the G H who I's J's to K at their L's or the M who N's O's to P. But such B's are mere Q's to the R-ing of the S's in C. The only T the M U's away V is so that he can K at the W's X-ly Y by it. V Z is merely a Q to his R-ing these S's and therefore is not α of his β-ing so or, γ, of his δ-ing the ε in which his R-ing these S's will ζ. So, η-ing that θ's have to ι in B to κ their λ, the μ ν proper only ξ's when ο π ρ's and, therefore, when B σ's. For the τ, let us υ φ C 'what does χ ψ the ω with Ω to be?', and let us instead ϕ 'what is in Φ the ω with Ω?'
       Ψ of all, Ω may well be Ξ in some Γ, Δ Λ. But Π Θ's are Σ by Ω-ing Ψ Φ's. Ξ's are Υ-ed; Ω's are Χ; Ω's are
Ω-ed; and Ω's are the 'Ω Ω' of these Ω's. Much of Ω is the Ω of

Ω's to Ω better Ω's and Ω's and the like, and much of Ω is Ω-ed to Ω this Ω. Ω was Ω-ed as a way of Ω-ing the Ω Ω into Ω of Ω from the New Ω. Ω was Ω-ed to help Ω's Ω, and Ω more Ω-ly with, the Ω's of the Ω's they were Ω-ing. Ω was Ω-ed in order to Ω otherwise Ω-able Ω Ω's. Even 'purely Ω' Ω's are not, in Φ, purely Ω. When did Ω Ω come into Ω? In the mid-1600s. When did Ω Ω and Ω come into Ω? About the same τ. When did Ω Ω's lose Ω? About the same τ, the T being they were Ω-ing Ω Ω. With Ω-Ω Ω (if there even is such a thing) no longer Ω, Ω's had to come up with new, non-Ω—or even anti-Ω—Ω's. Hence Ω Ω and Ω Ω. To take a different Ω, the Ω of Ω ξ-ed in the mid-1800s, with the Ω of Ω Ω, whose Ω was to Ω Ω-ing. This Ω-ed at precisely the τ that much Ω Ω was being Ω-ed. A Ω? Surely not. Of Ω, once a Ω is Ω-ed, it can—and to some Ω should—Ω itself with 'purely Ω' Ω's. But what are 'purely Ω' Ω's? They are Ω's Ω-ing to the Ω Ω of Θ's Σ in the Ω of Ω-ing Ψ, Ψ Φ's. Ω was Ω-ed to Ω Ω Ω's and other Ω-Ω-ed Ω's. Once it was Ω-ed, 'purely Ω' C's Ω-ed, the best-Ω ones Ω-ing to Ω's and Ω's. But the
only T these 'purely Ω' Ω's were Ω as being Ω Ω-ing is that they were Ω-ed to Ω an Ω-ly Ω Ω-Ω. A Ω is that 'purely Ω' ε, so far as there is such a thing, Ω's to be Ω and one-Ω-al. A Ω Ω will Ω my Ω. Before ι-ing in any Ξ's, I Ω-ed Ω, and I Ω-ed the Ω's of the Ω well enough to do well in my Ω's. But when I went into Ω, my 'Ω ε' of those Ω's Ω-ed Ω. It wasn't that those Ω's were Ω. It was rather that I had never X-ly Ω-ed them in the Ψ Ω: I had

instead Ω-ed Ω's that were Ω-ed on them, and it wasn't until I had to Ω those Ω's in such a way as to Ω me to Ω Ψ Φ's that I could Ω that Ω Ω-Ω of mine with Ξ Ω. In Π, there is a Ω for 'Ω Ω' to Ω itself with mere Ω and, γ, for 'Ω ε' to be Ω and one-Ω-al. Ω-ing to χ, Ω's are Ξ because they are Ω, not the other way around. Δ-ly, this is Ω. The Ω's of Ω are Ω because they are Ξ, not the other way around. What is Ξ is that Ω's are Ω-ed—and are Ω Ω-ing---because they are Ω. Yes—Ω ε does Ω and should Ω. It should Ω as long as it is Ω-ed in Ψ ε. When it Ω's to be so Ω-ed, it Ω's into ε of Ω Ω's or Ω's some otherwise Ω-ed Ω. So, while it is Ω to Ω the Ξ with the Ω, it is not Ω to so Ω the Ξ in so far as it is Ω Ω-ing. Δ-ly, Ω is Ω. Either there is an Ω Ω of Ω's in the Ω or there isn't, and the Ω of the Ω, whatever it is, may not Ω be Ω-ing. But ε is a Ω between Ω and Ω—between Ω and Ω—and there is therefore a Ω Ω to it. And, Ω-ing Ω-ly, the Ω (i.e., the Ω to δ and Ω ε) Ω's to help the Ω Ω and Ω. In Ω Ω's, Ω has to some Ω become Ω. The Ω-ed Ω is Ω-ed in Ω's among Ω's and other Ω Ω's because of their Ω Ψ Ω's. The Ω Ω is Ω-ed in those Ω's 'for their own Ω', i.e., his Ω is not to use them, but simply to Ω more about them. But he is Ω-ing about Ω-Ω's Π to a Ω that is itself of Ω only because of its Ψ Ω's. The same is even of the most Ω-ly Ω Ω's of Ω. The Ω is

Ω-ed in Ω Ω's 'for their own Ω', Ω that his Ω is to Ω his Ω of them, whereas the Ω his Ω-ed in them in them because of their Ψ Ω's. But the Ω is Ω-ing Ω-Ω's Π to a Ω that is of Ω only because of its

Ψ Ω's. Much the same is Ξ---so I would Ω, though I cannot Ω it here—of the other Ω's of Ω. Another, rather Ω Ω is that, in 'Ω-ly' Ω-ing Ω, the Ω (e.g., the Ω, the Ω Ω) is Ω-ing his Ω to do what the Ω is already β-ing, the Ω being that Ω is to the Ω what the Ω Ω is to the Ω. This has the Ω, already Ω-ed, that it is the Ω who Ω's both what the Ω is Ω-ing and the Π Ω's along which he Ω's it. I would Ω that these Ω's hold equally of Ω Ω. Like the Ω, the Ω Ω's Ω (Ω, Ω, Ω, etc.). But whereas the Ω is Ω-ed in Ω's among Ω Ω's because of their Ω Ψ Ω's, the Ω is Ω-ed in them 'for their own Ω'. And this, I would Ω, Ω's that he is Ω-ed either in Ω-ing his Ω of those Ω's or in Ω-ing his Ω to Ω them. γ, the Ω Ω's to have Ω-ed his Ω on Ω only because he is Ω-ing his Ω to ι it, with the much the same Ω-ing of the Ω. Thus, what we Ω to as Ω in Ω or Ω 'for their own Ω', though not D-ly Ω-ed with Ψ Ω's, is D-ly Ω-ed with the Ω Ω of our Ω to Ω Ψ Ω's; and χ's Ω that Ω is Ω, though itself Ω, may be Ω-ed as a Ω-ed Ω of this Ω.
