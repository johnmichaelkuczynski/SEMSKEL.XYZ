Create a new script called build_sentence_bank.js in the project root.
This script must read a text file that I upload, split it into sentences, bleach each sentence using my existing bleach(sentence) function, compute metadata, and write OUT a JSONL output file.
A JSONL file is just a plain text file with one JSON object per line.
Use the examples provided below to understand exactly what the output should look like.

THE SCRIPT MUST DO THE FOLLOWING:
1. Read input

Read a file named input_document.txt from the project root.
(I will upload this file manually.)

2. Split into sentences

Split the entire text into individual sentences.
A simple period-based sentence split is fine.

3. For each sentence, compute these fields exactly:

original → the exact sentence text

bleached → output of my existing function bleach(sentence)

char_length → number of characters in the original sentence

token_length → number of space-separated tokens in the original sentence

clause_count → count how many of these words appear:
when, because, although, if, while, since, but

clause_order →
If the sentence starts with a clause trigger word: "subordinate → main"
Otherwise: "main → subordinate"

punctuation_pattern → extract all punctuation characters in order

structure → should be identical to the bleached version

4. Write output file

Create a file named:

sentence_bank.jsonl

in the project root.

Each sentence must be written as one JSON object per line.

Nothing else.
No arrays.
No brackets.
No indentation.
No surrounding JSON.
Each line = one sentence.

🔥 ABSOLUTE REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT (MULTIPLE EXAMPLES)

The agent must study these examples and produce output exactly like them.

EXAMPLE LINE 1
{"original":"When the engine overheated, the system crashed.","bleached":"When X Y, Z.","char_length":49,"token_length":7,"clause_count":2,"clause_order":"subordinate → main","punctuation_pattern":",.","structure":"When X Y, Z."}

EXAMPLE LINE 2
{"original":"He left early.","bleached":"X V1-ed A1.","char_length":14,"token_length":3,"clause_count":1,"clause_order":"main → subordinate","punctuation_pattern":".","structure":"X V1-ed A1."}

EXAMPLE LINE 3
{"original":"Although the rain stopped, the streets stayed wet.","bleached":"Although X, Y.","char_length":53,"token_length":8,"clause_count":2,"clause_order":"subordinate → main","punctuation_pattern":",.","structure":"Although X, Y."}

EXAMPLE LINE 4 (ANOTHER FORMAT)
{"original":"People moved slowly through the streets.","bleached":"F1 V1-ed A1 through the F2.","char_length":43,"token_length":6,"clause_count":1,"clause_order":"main → subordinate","punctuation_pattern":".","structure":"F1 V1-ed A1 through the F2."}

EXAMPLE LINE 5 (SIMPLE SENTENCE)
{"original":"Nothing unusual happened.","bleached":"Nothing A1 V1-ed.","char_length":25,"token_length":3,"clause_count":1,"clause_order":"main → subordinate","punctuation_pattern":".","structure":"Nothing A1 V1-ed."}

5. Final step

After writing the file, the script must print:

"Finished. Run: node build_sentence_bank.js"

DO NOT:

Do not modify the bleaching function.

Do not change any existing project files except to add this new script.

Do not wrap the JSON in arrays.

Do not indent.

Do not use multiline JSON.

Do not include extra text.
