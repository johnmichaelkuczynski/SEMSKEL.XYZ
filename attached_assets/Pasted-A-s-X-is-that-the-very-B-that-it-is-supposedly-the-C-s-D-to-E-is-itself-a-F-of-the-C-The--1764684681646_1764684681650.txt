KKKK's XXXXXXX was SSSS, and TTTT the UUUU of VVVV WWWW 1, and


XXXX because of it, more or YYYY just ZZZZ, at which AAAAA the

"what GGGGG the VVVV CCCC?" as it is "what GGGGG the HHHHH

RRRR of very SSSS Z and a TTTT UUUU RRRR of very PPPP Z. Also, there was a VVVV WWWW XXX YYYY that (with some ZZZZ)


AAAA HHHHH as BBBB and CCCC. The HHHHH IIIII was


DDDD EEEE and FFFF (though not, GGGG, HHHH


IIII as JJJJ as the KKKKK IIIII that would LLLL it). KKKK MMMM's


LLLL had a 'too NNNN, too OOOO' PPPP. QQQQ RRRR OOOO and


SSSS it TTTT against the UUUU OOOOO but VVVV WWWW XXXX, which, as MMMMM YYYY, was not at that AAAAA ZZZZ by BBBB


CCCC to its (DDDD) 1917/1918 DDDDD-EEEE. FFFF and AAAA GGGG's HHHH-IIII JJJJ. What was the KKKK of


these JJJJ? Did GGGG LLLL his MMMM? Were there any NNNN


OOOO? OOOO and PPPP QQQQ. GGGG, though in some RRRR a 'BBBB SSSS', was TTTT just an UUUU


VVVV whose WWWW of XXXX were YYYY. And his ZZZZ 'HHHH


IIII JJJJ" were AAAA QQQQ of this. The HHHH-IIII JJJJ were BBBB


to CCCC and DDDD OOOO, by EEEE FFFF, GGGG, and the


HHHH, and in this RRRR IIII JJJJ OOOO's KKKK. It should be


LLLL out that JJJJ of the MMMM for the HHHH IIII JJJJ was NNNN MMMM,


OOOO by GGGG's PPPP QQQQ RRRR, which, though SSSS


TTTT by GGGG's UUUU to VVVV onto DDDDD by WWWW XXXX,


YYYY and ZZZZ XXXX AAAA, BBBB CCCC (to some DDDD)


about EEEE the MMMM-FFFF for GGGG's GGGG HHHH


IIII. In any JJJJ, the HHHH IIII JJJJ were DDDD in some KKKK;


they did LLLL the KKKKK HHHHH into an HHHH and MMMM DDDDD. But they


were NNNN OOOO in other KKKK, in that, even though they SSSS the KKKKK HHHHH MMMM PPPP, they SSSS the KKKKK Z PPPP and they


also RRRR the SSSS, which GGGGG its TTTT 50 IIII OOOO. FFFF the UUUU of DDDDD under the KKKKK VVVV. What


WWWW were most PPPP? How did this XXXX from the RRRR DDDDD is


YYYY to be UUUU? XXXXXX ZZZZ that you PPPP QQQQ and


AAAA the BBBB of CCCC DDDD. The EEEE FFFF of the KKKKK HHHHH would GGGG a HHHH


IIII, this being a JJJJ of 'KKKK of LLLL' of the KKKKK HHHHH. The


HHHH IIII would GGGG a MMMM, this being NNNN, within


OOOO, to the PPPP's 'QQQQ.' The MMMM would GGGG a RRRR


SSSS, who was the TTTT SSSS of the UUUU KKKKK HHHHH. The


VVVV of these 'WWWW' were, at XXXX during the GGGG IIII and to a


YYYY DDDD OOOO, ZZZZ-AAAA by BBBB XXXX CCCC. But that is


the RRRR in which those CCCC were DDDD EEEE FFFF. The HHHH


IIII and MMMM, under the GGGG of the RRRR SSSS, would


HHHH IIII/JJJJ to KKKK FFFF HHHH IIII, which, in


their LLLL, would MMMM their NNNN PPPPP OOOO. What is PPPP RRRR? Do you QQQQ that PPPP RRRR is ZZZZZ for


the SSSS of TTTT? OOOO. How did the KKKKK HHHHH UUUU with


PPPP RRRR? Has OOOO under VVVV's WWWW been any XXXX? Do


you YYYY OOOO can ZZZZ TTTT AAAA on its BBBB with PPPP


RRRR? PPPP RRRR is the CCCC of WWWW and DDDD and EEEE in a


DDDD SSSS that are not either XXXX or FFFF GGGG in in HHHH. Thus, IIII, JJJJ (except for C-KKKK JJJJ), LLLL MMMM,


and NNNN OOOO (e.g. one's OOOO PPPP of XXXX QQQQ or


GGGG RRRR) are SSSS of PPPP RRRR. PPPP RRRR is not


TTTT ZZZZZ for TTTT. In a RRRR of HHHH UUUU---VVVV


of whom had any WWWW XXXX from their YYYY ZZZZ—there would


still be a SSSSS for, and a AAAAA of, TTTT. In BBBBB, TTTT


WWWW are CCCCC DDDDD when it EEEEE to the FFFFF of


HHHH ZZZZ, GGGGG of one's HHHHH to IIIII in JJJJJ. Under the KKKKK


HHHHH, PPPP RRRR was LLLLL MMMM. Under VVVV, PPPP RRRR is not


NNNNN MMMM, OOO


Nor are there are any X Y as to how to Z this. Nor, indeed,


does there seem to be the A B C. My D E is that


there were F-G for H I in J—G that


K-ed the L M of N (which, incidentally, does


O)---this might P to the Q R of S T. But


any U on these V are W X at this Y. Did the Z AA BB or CC DD? Was the


    EE a FF GG or an HH-FF GG? (II/JJ)


 


      The KK EE is at its LL a FF GG, and since


the KK EE is the MM of the B NN of its OO,


these being the Z AA, it PP that the Z AA


QQ-ed DD. In this RR, it will be SS, TT on the UU of


VV WW from the XX (YY) KK EE, that the ZZ is a


AAA if not a BBB FF GG. Then we will CCC that


some DDD EEE-FF FFF of the EE are in GGG


FF. HHH, we will III the JJJ that during the KKK LLL of the


MMM, only NNN OOO PPP could QQQ, and we will CCC that this


RRR EEE-FF SSS does not TTT the EE or the


Z AA to be EEE-FF. A DD is a UUU in which the VVV WWW their XXX. In


the YYY of ZZZ AAAA in the BBBB-EE, CCCC


ZZZ XXX are DDDD and those that are not DDDD are EEEE


by those who are. First of all, FFFF are GGGG for the HHHH of


IIII, JJJJ and a KKKK LLLL (or MMMM). In NNNN I,


OOOO 2 of the BBBB-EE PPPP: "The QQQQ of IIII shallbe RRRR of SSSS TTTT every UUUU VVVV by the VVV of the


WWWW XXXX, and the YYYY in each XXXX shall have the ZZZZ


AAAAA for YYYY of the most BBBBB CCCCC of the XXXX


DDDDD…."


      This EEEEE FFFFF it that "the VVV", this being some GGGGG of the


HHHHH IIIII, JJJJJ who their KKKKK IIII will be, at


least within LLLLL. Later in NNNN I, OOOO 2 it is MMMMM that: "IIII and


NNNNN OOOOO shall be PPPPP among the WWWW XXXX which may be


QQQQQ within this RRRRR, according to their SSSSS TTTTT, which


shall be UUUUU by VVVVV to the WWWWW TTTTT of XXXXX YYYYY,


including those ZZZZZ to AAAAAA for a BBBBBB of CCCCCC… When DDDDDDD


happen in the EEEEEE from any XXXX, the FFFFFFF GGGGGGG thereof


shall HHHHHHH IIIIIII of HHHH to JJJJJJJ such DDDDDDD."


      The first KKKKKK of this LLLLLL MMMMMM that the NNNNN of


EEEEEE OOOOOO to a XXXX is a PPPPPP of the TTTTT of VVV in that


XXXX, and the UUUUU KKKKKK MMMMMM that it is the QQQQQ of that XXXX who


RRRRR who will SSSSS them. The last KKKKKK of NNNN I, OOOO 2 TTTTT that: "The QQQQ of


IIII…shall have the UUUUU VVVVV of WWWWW." In other


XXXXX, these IIII have the VVVVV to YYYYY the MMMM fromZZZZZ (or at least to AAAAAA BBBBBB to the CCCCCC), this being a DDDDDD of


EEEEE the MMMM under the FFFFFF of DDDD XXX. The BBBB-EE GGGGG for the QQQQ of IIII to be


HHHHH IIIII, since it JJJJJ both that the VVV in a KKKK


XXXX WWWW their IIII and also that the TTTTT of IIII


per XXXX is LLLLL to that XXXX's IIIII. In OOOO III of the BBBB-EE, it is MMMMM that: "The MMMMM


of the NNNNN XXXX shall be RRRR of two JJJJ from each XXXX,


TTTT by the DDDDD thereof, for six CCCCCC; and each OOOO shall have


one PPPPP." Thus, the BBBB-EE GGGGG for the MMMMM to be a


HHHHH IIIII QQQQQ, since although it JJJJJ that the VVV


of a KKKK XXXX shall WWWW their own JJJJ, it does not RRRRR that the


TTTTT of JJJJ per XXXX is LLLLL to that XXXX's IIIII. In NNNN II, OOOO 1, it is MMMMM that: "The SSSSS VVVVV shall


be TTTTT in a MMMM of the NNNNN XXXX of UUUUU. He shall VVVVV his


ZZZZZ during the BBBBBB of four CCCCCC, and, together with the WWWW MMMM,


TTTT for the same BBBBBB, be DDDD, as XXXXX." Each XXXX has a TTTTT of


'YYYYY.' The TTTTT of YYYYY per XXXX is LLLLL to the IIIII


of that XXXX. The YYYYY for a KKKK XXXX ZZZZZ PPPPP for the


AAAAA BBBBB CCCCC for by a DDDDD of the VVV in that XXXX. So it


is these YYYYY who EEEEE PPPPP for MMMM; the VVV only FFFFF doSS. But these YYYYY always PPPPP in GGGGG with the CCCCC HHHHH by the DDDDD


of their IIIII. JJJJJ, a XXXX's QQQQQ do not EEEEE PPPPP for MMMM. Rather,


their XXXX EEEEE CCCCC for the MMMM, and they PPPPP for who their XXXX


will PPPPP for. This YYY FFFFF it KKKKK for a AAAAA BBBBB who LLLLL


the MMMMM PPPPP to NNNNN the HHHH, and some might OOOOO this YYY as


EEE-IIIII or only PPPPP IIIII. But that is not the only


QQQQQ RRRRR of the SSSSS. The TTTTT YYY UUUUU the PPPPP to XXXX, and


it therefore VVVVV all of the IIIII WWWWW XXXXX out by XXXX. There is an YYYYY ZZZZ in which the NNNNN XXXX in YYYY was


not IIIII. Only AAAAA, BBBBB CCCCC-DDDDD could PPPPP. EEEEE could not. FFFFF GGGGG could not. HHHHH-GGGGG could not. And,


IIIII, JJJJJ while BBBBB could not. (Be it KKKKK that the YYYY-


EE does not itself LLLLL the PPPPP to NNN while BBBBB. The


MMMMM was NNNNN on the SSSSS, it being the OOOOO at PPPPP that QQQQQ


RRRRR in this DDDDDD.)


      Why was this? Although an SSSSS of TTTTT, UUUUU and VVVVV


may have WWWWW a XXXXX, this YYY was ZZZZZ about AAAAA RRRRR


to VVV who had an BBBBB CCCCC in the DDDDD of the EEEEE. FFFFF, GGGGG did not HHHHH the EEEEE to be an BBBBB IIIII, sinceit was JJJJJ them their KKKKK, and if LLLLL the MMMMM to PPPPP, they might


well have CCCCC for its NNNNN. As for FFFFF GGGGG, even though the


NNNNN XXXX did not OOOOO them and even though they had PPPPP QQQQQ


to it, their DDDDD did not RRRRR on its DDDDD, and for this SSSSS they


could not be TTTTT to PPPPP for its DDDDD. As for EEEEE in this UUUUU


VVVVV, they were not WWWWW in XXXXX and, however YYYYY their


ZZZZZ towards the NNNNN XXXX, might have been, they could not be


TTTTT upon to PPPPP in an AAAAA BBBBB. The same is CCCCC of AAAAA BBBBB


who had no DDDDD: however YYYYY their ZZZZZ might have been, they


could not be TTTTT upon to PPPPP in an AAAAA BBBBB. EEEEE, the YYYY-EE did not FFFFF anyone from GGGGGG,


and it has HHHHH IIIII to JJJJJ so as to KKKKK RRRRR to VVV who did not


LLLLL have it. This was by MMMMM. The Z AA NNNNN a


YYY that had a OOOOO IIIII PPPPP. That YYY has not


always been QQQQQ in a RRRRR IIIII DDDDDD, but that is only


because it has not always been QQQQQ as it was SSSSS to be. In TTTTT, the YYYY KK-EE UUUUU a VVVV IIIII


YYY of ZZZ. Although it WWWWW some DDD EEE-IIIII


FFFF, these FFFF XXXXX upon YYYYY not to be EEE-IIIII or to


be only HHHHH so. As for the JJJ that only AAAAA NNN BBBBB could


PPPPP during the KKK LLL of this EEEEE's ZZZZZ, that had no UUU in theEE, which did not FFFFF anyone from GGGGGG, and was instead a


AAAAA of the DDDDDD in which the EE was QQQQQ. The Two BBBBB of CCCCC's DDDDD EEEEE VVVVV:


          CCCCC's FFFFF and GGGGG HHHHH as a IIIII of DDDDD EEEEE VVVVV


                                        (JJ)


 


      There are two JJJJJ of VVVVV that a KKKKK can have: LLLLL VVVVV and


EEEEE VVVVV. LLLLL VVVVV is the MMMMM to NNNNN OOOOO PPPPP or BBBBB


QQQQQ. EEEEE VVVVV is about RRRRR, as SSSSS to TTTTT. A KKKKK's


EEEEE VVVVV UUUUU in the VVVVV of its WWWWW, the XXXXX that others have


about its YYYYY, and its ZZZZZ AAAAA. Just as there are two JJJJJ of VVVVV, so there are two JJJJJ of EEEEE


VVVVV: BBBBB and DDDDD. BBBBB EEEEE VVVVV is the VVVVV to RRRRR


other CCCCC to DDDDD in a EEEEE or FFFFF GGGGG, e.g. to HHHHH


a IIIII. DDDDD EEEEE VVVVV is the VVVVV to RRRRR other CCCCC to DDDDD


in a DDDDD or JJJJJ GGGGG, e.g. to KKKKK to LLLLL with some KKKKK


or to MMMMM NNNNN from


      There are two JJJJJ of DDDDD EEEEE VVVVV: the OOOOO JJJJJ and the


PPPPP JJJJJ. In other XXXXX, DDDDD EEEEE VVVVV can sometimes, be QQQQQ


RRRRR, but it can also just 'SSSSS', without its being TTTTT by the


KKKKK in UUUUU. An VVVVV of OOOOO DDDDD EEEEE VVVVV would be


the U.S.'s WWWWW the XXXXX YYYYY in ZZZZZ: this was not a IIIII of the


KK's TTTTT anybody, PPPPP or otherwise. But it AAAAA a BBBBB to othernations that the NNNNN XXXX CCCCC a DDDDD RRRRR of the XXXXX EEEEE, which


BBBBB in FFFFF GGGGG those other CCCCC' HHHHH IIIII about the


XXXXX EEEEE. A IIIII of PPPPP DDDDD EEEEE VVVVV would be the JJJJJ for


the KK in the KKKKK LLLLL that have MMMMM from the KK's NNNNN to


OOOOO the KKKKK LLLLL with its PPPPP WWWWW, which NNNNN were QQQQQ in the


KKKKK LLLLL not as RRRRR of SSSSS but as RRRRR of WWWWW TTTTT and


of UUUUU VVVVV. In this WWWWW, I am XXXXX to CCC that CCCCC, through its YYYYY and


ZZZZZ AAAAA (BRI), is BBBBB a TTTTT of CCCCC DDDDD of EEEEE VVVVV:


BBBBB, OOOOO DDDDD, and PPPPP DDDDD. On the one FFFFF, as


we will CCC, some CCC this HHHHH as a GGGGG NNNNN on CCCCC's IIIII to


HHHHH BBBBB (and JJJJJ) KKKKK between CCCCC: so to this LLLLL, it is a


IIIII of BBBBB EEEEE VVVVV. On the other FFFFF, some CCC it as NNNNN on


C


The actual R Q came into existence in the 1830s and was


A-ed by B C, as an attempt to D E away from


F-s and into the hands of the G-es, and the actual H Q


was A-ed in 1854, largely as an attempt to end I but also as an


attempt J power and K the L under M N-


O P-ies. As the just-Q-ed R-s make clear, there have been S T-s


within and between the Q-ies. Someone with B C's U-s


would now being V-ed as the W of a X; in fact, C's


Y-s were strongly in line with those of current Z AA BB. (BB, though CC and though in some ways a DD of the CC,


is also an EE-FF, just as C was.) And GG, though a


H, probably had U-s at least in some ways more in line with


those of HH I-s. (That said, GG was in other JJ-s


quite KK of LL MM, mainly in that, despite his


NN OO-s on PP-QQ-s, he RR-ed the SS-s of the


TT UU over the more VV and in some ways WW-XX


YY.)


      But even more ZZ than what has AAA-ed the BBB Q


CCC-s over the last 250 DDD-s is what hasn't AAA-ed. During any given EEE FFF, there is one Q that GGG-es on HHH-OOO PPP, and


another that GGG-es on 'the III JJJ'; there is one Q that KKK-s to


J power and another that KKK-s to LLL it; there is one Q


that KKK-s to MMM to the NNN, and another that OOO-s the


NNN as being PPP-ed. In some QQQ-s, in some JJ-s, the


H Q RRR-s, or is V-ed as RRR-ing, the SS-s of SSS


TTT-es; in other UUU-s, the R Q has that VVV. At certain


WWW-s, the H Q is relatively XXX and relatively


YYY-ed to go to ZZZ, and the R Q, being less XXX, is


relatively AAAA-ed to do so; and at the other WWW-s, the BBBB-s are CCCC-ed. Despite the DDDD-es between the two Q-ies, there was a EEEE of


FFFF or GGGG between the H-s and the R-s. They


HHHH-ed to IIII on certain JJJJ-s and to agree on KKKK-s, and their LLLL-


and-MMMM had a rather NNNN-ed, OOOO-like PPPP to it. But with BB


BB that AAA-ed (whether for QQQQ or RRRR is obviously a SSSS of


TTTT). What is UUUU about BB is that he came into CCC-s from


the VVVV. He is not a WWWW; he is a XXXX who went into CCC-s. And this is YYYY-ed in his OO-s, which are in some ways more ZZZZ to


H AAAAA-ies than to R AAAAA-ies. (BB actually


BBBBB-s quite well to R CCCCC-s about the H Q,


and for that same DDDDD BB does not BBBBB well to H EEEEE-s to FFFFF the R Q.) In any GGGGG, though, BBB Q


CCC-s was HHHHH to come into IIIII and JJJJJ a KKKKK barely


LLLLL from its HH KKKKK. Be it MMMMM that, in his NNNNN


OOOOO, PPPPP QQQQQ, the RRRRR of LL SSSSS, TTTTT-ed


that, for UUUUU-s of VVVVV, WWWWW need XXXXX Q-ies and, at the same


XXXXX, that they cannot have more than two. And it would seem that QQQQQ


was right. YYYYY


 


      YYYYY has a ZZZZZ AAAAAA. What exactly does this mean? Specifically, BBBBBB the CCCCCC of the DDDDDD and EEEEEE FFFFFF-s in


this AAAAAA. Would you GGGGGG the ZZZZZ AAAAAA for other


HHHHHH? IIIIII why or why not


 


      Much like JJJJJJ, YYYYY has a KKKKK-LLLLL AAAAAA of


MMMMMM, NNNNN that there is a OOOOO-PPPPP as well as Z, both


of whom are QQQQQ to the RRRRRR's SSSSS. A KKKKK-LLLLL


AAAAAA TTTTTT from a UUUUU VVVVV in that in the WWWWW of a


UUUUU VVVVV the Z is a mere XXXXX YYYYY, whereas in the


WWWWW of a KKKKK-LLLLL VVVVV has real power. And KKKKK-LLLLL


AAAAAA TTTTTT from a LLLLL AAAAAA in that, whereas in a LLLLL


AAAAAA the ZZZZZ is AAAAAA by the Z and can also be BBBBBB by


him, in a KKKKK-LLLLL AAAAAA the ZZZZZ is AAAAAA by the SSSSS


and cannot be CCCCCC BBBBBB by the Z. In YYYYY, the Z


DDDDDD the OOOOO PPPPP. YYYYY's MMMMMM, like the USA's, is EEEEE into DDDDDD,


EEEEEE, and FFFFFF FFFFFF-s. And the FFFFFF FFFFFF, like the USA's, is


EEEEE into a GGGGGG HHHHHH, IIIIII to the US JJJJJJ of KKKKKK, and a LLLLLL, IIIIII to the US LLLLLL. The EEEEEE MMMMMM in YYYYY, though basically NNNNN to its


BBB OOOOOO. In the United States, the PPPPPP QQQQQQ does not


RRRRRR the SSSSSS of a TTTTTT UU; it merely RRRRRR the


SSSSSS of VV-WWWWWW UU-s, and then only under when their


SSSSSS is made XXXXXX by YYYYYY or ZZZZZZ AAAAAAA. But in YYYYY,


in BBBBBBB for a CCCCCCC to become UU, its SSSSSS must be RRRRRR in


DDDDDDD (by the SSSSSS EEEEEEE) and so must its FFFFFFF with


GGGGGGG HHHHHHH and IIIIIII UU-s (by the JJJJJJJ d'état). But the KKKKKKK


LLLLLL between the BBB and the YYYYY AAAAAA is that, whereas the


BBB AAAAAA is LLLLL, the YYYYY AAAAAA is KKKKK-LLLLL, so


that the YYYYY AAAAAA has a 'MMMMM DDDDDD' FFFFFF. The NNNNNNN of a KKKKK-LLLLL over a LLLLL AAAAAA is that


it OOOOOOO to PPPPPPP XXXXX QQQQQQQ, mainly by RRRRRRR it SSSSSSS for the


Z to TTTTTTT power without the UUUUUU of both the OOOOO PPPPP


and the SSSSS. So the SSSSS and the DDDDDD have VVVVVV WWWWWW


far enough XXXXXX from each other for there to be YYYYYYY ZZZZZZZ


between them. At the same XXXXX, this is also, at least in some QQQ-s, a


AAAAAAAA, since it BBBBBBBB the Z CCC the DDDDDD EEEEEEE that


may be FFFFFFF to GGGGGGG with HHHHHHH. My IIIIIII OO is that, while there should be JJJJJJJ and KKKKKKK and that LLLLL MMMMMMM must be NNNNNNN, the LLLLL has more


than enough JJJJJJJ and KKKKKKK on the Z's power. By the same


OOOOOOO, the KKKKK-LLLLL PPPPPPP QQQQQQ-RRRRRRR the Z and


(unless, as is the WWWWW in JJJJJJ, which is really an SSSSSSS and only


TTTTTTT a KKKKK-LLLLL AAAAAA) and BBBBBBBB him from CCC UUUUUU and


(in some QQQ-s) FFFFFFF VVVVVV. JJJJJJ


 


      How has WWWWWWW XXXXXXX JJJJJJ XXXXX YYYYYYY over the


ZZZZZZZ? The JJJJJJ AAAAAAA was BBBBBBB extremely CCCCCCC. Also, much of it,


being DDDDDDD or EEE-DDDDDDD, is very FFFFFFF. Further, even though it has the


CCCCCCC GGGGGGG of any HHHHHH, that GGGGGGG is on the DDDDDDD IIIIIII and is


therefore of JJJJJJJ UUU for either KKKKKKK or for JJJJJJ's LLLLLLL-


MMMMMMM. JJJJJJ's NNNNNNN, though in some JJ-s a OOOOOOO, left it


PPPPPPP to QQQQQQQ and made it RRRRRR to SSSSSSS, this being why, over the


ZZZZZZZ, it TTTTTTT a UUUUUUU of VVVVVVV WWWWWWW at the XXXXXXX of YYYYYYY


ZZZZZZZ AAAAAAA and BBBBBBB AAAAAAA HHHHHH. Also, whereas the United States is CCCCCCC with DDDDDDD-EEEEEEE FFFFFFF


GGGGGGG, the GGGGGGG in JJJJJJ is relatively HHH-FFFFFFF and the IIIIIII is


JJJJJJJ to many KKKKKK of LLLLLLL. JJJJJJ's MMMMMMM NNNNNNN,


OOOOOOO with PPPPPPP NNNNNNN and the QQQQQQQ RRRRRRR in JJJJJJ-SSSSSSS


(and therefore largely GGGGGGG-TTTTTTT) UUUUUUU, had the VVVVVVV that JJJJJJ as a WWWWWW


was in some ways more XXXXXXX than other IIIIIII YYYYYYY, being


ZZZZZZZ than most other IIIIIII YYYYYYY (including some BBBBBBB IIIIIII


YYYYYYY) to AAAAAAA the BBBBBBB of XXXXX CCCCCCC. Also, the QQQQQQQ RRRRRRR in DDDDDDD from JJJJJJ's EEEEEEE FFFFFFF (e.g. St. GGGGGGG and HHHHHHH)—all of which are IIIIIII in the far JJJJJJJ of the


HHHHHH and in which JJJJJJ's KKKKKK as well as its LLLLLLL OOOOOOO to


MMMMMM---NNNNNNN an OOOOOOO CCCCCCC PPPPPPP in QQQQQQQ and in RRRRRRR of


SSSSSSS between the TTTTTTT and the HHH-TTTTTTT of JJJJJJ, which UUUUUUU make


JJJJJJ VVVVVVV to the 1917 WWWWWWW. Additionally, JJJJJJ, being CCCCCCC and being RRRRRR to UUUUUUU within,


was (and is) RRRRRR to XXXXXXX and to YYYYYYY, which is probably ZZZZZZZ of what


made JJJJJJ ZZZZZZZ to AAAAAAA BBBBBBB CCCCCCC and which, in DDDDDDD, was ZZZZZZZ of


what it made relatively EEEEEEE for the FFFFFFF to take over. To this GGGGGGG,


JJJJJJ is HHHHHHH in a KKKKK-SSSSSSS IIIIIII, and its JJJJJJJ of FFFFFFF IIIIIII has


VVVVVVV in an KKKKKKK that LLLLLLL-MMMMMMM in NNNNNNN OOOOOOO. Further, its PPPPPPP IIIIIII and QQQQQQ SSSSSSS RRRRRRR make it RRRRRR


(but not SSSSSSS) to TTTTTTT UUUUUUU VVVVVV WWWWWWW. What led to the XXXXXXX of the YYYYYYY ZZZZZZZ? (CCC-s/AAAAAAA/BBBBBBB


                                        CCCCCCC)


 


      The DDDDDDD EEEEEEE of the XXXXXXX of the YYYYYYY ZZZZZZZ was the


FFFFFFF of GGGGGGG HHHHHHH that IIIIIII in the late 80s. JJJJJJ, being a JJJJJJJ,


KKKKKKK LLLLLLL YYYYYYY had very III KKKKKKK, and its MMMMMMM came


almost entirely from NNNNNNN OOOOOOO. So when NNNNNNN HHHHHHH fell in the


late 80s, JJJJJJ was completely PPPPPPP, and its KKKKKKK literally


QQQQQQQ to a RRRRRRR: SSSSSSS TTTTTTT UUUUUUU didn't even VVVVVV the WWWWWW, since


XXXXXXX weren't being YYYYYYY. The ZZZZZZZ in HHHHHHH was AAAAAAA, being the BBBBBBB of strongly


CCCCCCC-YYYYYYY US Z DDDDDD EEEEEEE, who had already done much to


FFFFFFF YYYYYYY GGGGGGG by HHHHHHH in it a IIIIIII JJJJJJ KKKKKKK. (It was unclear


whether it was EEEEEEE's LLLLLLL in HHHHHHH in the JJJJJJ KKKKKKK to


PPPPPPP the YYYYYYY ZZZZZZZ. Some believe EEEEEEE's MMMMMMM were of a


NNNNNNN-OOOOOOO CCCCCCC-LLLLLLL QQQQQQQ. KKKKKK believe that, indeed, EEEEEEE was


RRRRRRR SSSSSSS the YYYYYYY ZZZZZZZ to TTTTT

And the X₁ branch, like the Y₂'s, is


X₃-ed into a X₄ X₅, X₆-ing to the Y₂ X₇ ofX₈, and a X₉, X₆-ing to the Y₂ X₉. The X₁₀ X₁₁ in Y₁₂, though X₁₃ X₁₄ to its


Y₂ X₁₅. In the Y₁₆ Y₁₇, the X₁₈ X₁₉ does not


X₂₀ the X₂₁ of a X₂₂ X₂₃; it merely X₂₀'s the


X₂₁-ity of X₂₄ X₂₃'s, and then only under when their


X₂₁-ity is made X₂₅ by X₂₆ or X₂₇ X₂₈. But in Y₁₂,


in order for a X₂₉ to become X₂₃, its X₂₁-ity must be X₃₀-ed in


X₃₁ (by the X₂₁ X₃₂) and so must its X₃₃ with


X₃₄ X₄ and Y₃₅ X₂₃'s (by the X₃₆ d'X₃₇). But the X₃₈


X₃₉ between the Y₂ and the Y₁₂ X₄₀ is that, whereas the


Y₂ X₄₀ is X₄₁, the Y₁₂ X₄₀ is X₄₂-X₄₁, so


that the Y₁₂ X₄₀ has a 'X₄₃ X₄₄' branch. The X₄₅ of a X₄₂-X₄₁ over a X₄₁ X₄₀ is that


it X₄₆'s to X₄₇ X₄₈ X₄₉, X₅₀ by X₅₁-ing it X₅₂ for the


X₅₃ to X₅₄ X₅₅ without the X₅₆ of both the X₅₇ X₅₈


and the X₅₉. So the X₅₉ and the X₄₄ have X₆₀ X₆₁-ing


X₆₂ X₆₃ apart from each other for there to be X₆₄ X₆₅'s


between them. At the same time, this is also, at least in some X₆₆'s, a


X₆₇, since it X₄₇'s the X₅₃ X₆₈-ing the X₆₉ X₇₀'s that


may be X₇₁ to X₇₂ with X₇₃'s. My X₇₄ X₇₅ is that, while there should be X₇₆'s and X₇₇'sand that X₄₁ X₇₈ must be X₇₉-ed, the X₄₁ has more


than X₆₃ X₇₆'s and X₇₇'s on the X₅₃'s X₅₅. By the same


X₈₀, the X₄₂-X₄₁ X₈₁ over-X₈₂'s the X₅₃ and


(unless, as is the case in Y₈₃, which is really an X₈₄ and only


X₈₅ a X₄₂-X₄₁ X₄₀) and X₄₇'s him from X₆₈-ing X₆₉ and


(in some X₆₆'s) X₇₁ X₈₆. Y₈₃'s X₈₇ in X₈₈ to its X₄₈ X₈₉


 


      How has X₈₇ X₉₀-ed Y₈₃ X₄₈ X₈₉ over the


X₉₁'s? The Y₈₃ X₉₂ was X₉₃ X₉₄ X₉₅. Also, much of it,


being X₉₆ or X₉₇-X₉₆, is X₉₈ X₉₉. Further, even though it has the


X₃₈ X₁₀₀ of any X₁₀₁, that X₁₀₀ is on the X₉₆ X₁₀₂ and is


therefore of X₁₀₃ X₁₀₄ for either X₁₀₅ or for Y₈₃'s X₁₀₆-


X₁₀₇. Y₈₃'s X₁₀₈, though in some X₁₀₉'s a X₁₁₀, X₁₁₁ it


X₁₁₂-ed to X₁₁₃'s and made it X₁₁₄ to X₁₁₅, this being why, over the


X₉₁'s, it X₁₁₆-ed a X₁₁₇ of X₁₁₈ X₁₁₉'s at the X₁₂₀'s of X₁₂₁


Y₁₂₂ X₁₂₃ and Y₁₂₄ X₁₂₃ X₁₀₁'s. Also, whereas the Y₁₆ Y₁₇ is X₁₂₅ with X₁₂₆-X₁₂₇ X₁₂₈


X₁₂₉, the X₁₂₉ in Y₈₃ is X₁₃₀ X₁₃₁-X₁₂₈ and the X₁₃₂ is


X₁₃₃ to many X₁₃₄'s of X₁₃₅. Y₈₃'s X₁₃₆ X₁₃₇,


X₁₃₈-ed with X₁₃₉ X₁₀₈ and the X₁₄₀'s X₁₄₁-ed in Y₈₃-X₁₄₂


(and therefore X₁₄₃ X₁₂₉-X₁₄₄-ed) X₁₄₅, had the X₁₄₆ that Y₈₃ as a X₁₄₇


was in some X₁₄₈'s more X₁₄₉ than other Y₃₅ X₁₅₀'s, being


X₁₅₁ than most other Y₃₅ X₁₅₀'s (including some Y₁₅₂ Y₃₅


X₁₅₀'s) to X₁₅₃ the X₁₅₄'s of X₄₈ X₁₅₅. Also, the


X₁₄₀'s X₁₄₁-ed in X₁₅₆-ing from Y₈₃'s X₁₅₇ X₁₅₈'s (e.g. Y₁₅₉ and Y₁₆₀)—all of which are X₁₆₁-ed in the X₆₂ Y₁₆₂ of the


X₁₀₁ and in which Y₈₃'s X₁₆₃ as well as its X₁₆₄ X₁₆₅-ed to


X₁₆₆---X₁₆₇-ed an X₁₆₈ X₉₅ X₁₆₉ in X₁₇₀ and in X₁₇₁ of


X₁₇₂-ing between the X₁₇₃ and the X₁₇₄-X₁₇₃ of Y₈₃, which X₁₇₅-ed X₁₇₆ Y₈₃


X₁₇₇ to the X₁₇₈ Y₁₇₉. X₁₈₀, Y₈₃, being X₉₅ and being X₁₁₄ to X₁₄₅ within,


was (and is) X₁₁₄ to X₁₈₁ and to X₁₈₂, which is probably part of what


made Y₈₃ X₁₅₁ to X₁₈₃ X₁₈₄ X₁₈₅ and which, in turn, was part of


what it made X₁₃₀ X₁₈₆ for the X₁₈₇'s to X₁₈₈ over. To this day,


Y₈₃ is X₁₈₉-ed in a X₄₂-X₈₄ X₁₉₀, and its X₁₉₁ of X₁₂₈ X₁₉₀ has


X₁₉₂-ed in an X₁₉₃ that over-X₁₉₄'s in X₁₉₅ X₁₉₆'s. Further, its X₁₁₈ X₁₃₂ and X₁₉₇ X₁₄₂ X₁₉₈'s X₁₇₆ it X₁₁₄


(but not X₅₂) to X₁₉₉ X₂₀₀ X₂₀₁ X₂₀₂. The X₂₀₃ of the Y₂₀₄ Y₂₀₅? What X₂₀₆-ed to the X₂₀₃ of the Y₂₀₇? The X₂₀₈ X₂₀₉ of the X₂₀₃ of the Y₂₀₄ Y₂₀₅ was the


X₂₁₀-ing of X₂₁₁ X₂₁₂'s that X₂₁₃-ed in the X₂₁₄ 80s. Y₈₃, being a X₂₁₅, X₂₁₆ X₁₈₄ X₁₅₀ had X₉₈ X₂₁₇ X₁₉₃, and its X₂₁₈ X₂₁₉


X₂₂₀ X₂₂₁ from X₁₉₅ X₁₉₆'s. So when X₁₉₅ X₂₁₂'s X₂₂₂ in the


X₂₁₄ 80s, Y₈₃ was X₂₂₃ X₂₂₄-ed, and its X₁₉₃ X₂₂₅


X₂₂₆-ed to a X₂₂₇: X₂₂₈'s X₂₂₉-ing X₂₃₀ X₂₃₁'t even X₂₃₂ the X₂₃₃, since


X₂₃₄'s X₂₃₅'t being X₂₃₆-ed. The X₂₃₇ in X₂₁₂'s was X₂₃₈, being the X₂₃₉ of X₂₄₀


X₂₄₁-Y₂₀₄ Y₁₆ X₅₃ Y₂₄₂ Y₂₄₃, who had already X₂₄₄-ed much to


X₂₄₅ Y₂₀₄ X₂₄₆'s by X₂₄₇-ing in it a X₂₄₈ X₂₄₉ X₂₅₀. (It was X₂₅₁


whether it was Y₂₄₃'s X₂₅₂ in X₂₄₇-ing in the X₂₄₉ X₂₅₀ to


X₂₂₄ the Y₂₀₄ Y₂₀₅. Some X₂₅₃ Y₂₄₃'s X₂₅₄'s were of a


X₂₅₅-X₂₅₆ X₂₄₁-X₁₈₄ X₂₅₇. Others X₂₅₃ that, indeed, Y₂₄₃ was


X₂₃₈ X₂₅₈-ing the Y₂₀₄ Y₂₀₅ to X₂₅₉ and X₂₆₀ X₂₀₃.)


      Because Y₈₃ had no X₂₆₁ X₂₆₂ X₂₆₃ on the X₂₆₄ of which to


X₂₆₅ X₂₆₆'s, a X₂₆₇ to X₁₈₄ was not an X₂₆₈. At the same time,


Y₈₃ had a X₁₉₇ X₂₆₉-X₂₆₃ X₁₉₃ and—as the next few X₂₇₀'s wouldX₁₇₆ X₂₇₁—no X₂₇₂ of X₂₇₃ X₂₇₄. So (after a X₂₇₀'s of


X₁₉₃ X₂₇₅, X₂₇₆ of Y₂₇₇ Y₂₇₈ and other Y₁₆₂ X₁₉₃ X₂₇₉'s) the X₂₈₀ X₁₂₀ of X₂₈₁-X₂₈₂-ing X₂₈₃ made X₂₈₄ for the X₂₈₅


X₁₂₀ of the X₂₆₂ X₂₆₃. Y₈₃'s X₂₈₆ X₄₈ X₄₀


 


      What X₂₅₇ of X₄₈ X₄₀ does Y₈₃ have now? Is it X₂₈₇? X₂₆₁? X₂₈₈. Y₈₃ is a X₂₁ (X₂₁-X₁₄₄-ed) X₂₈₉, X₄₂-


X₄₁ Y₂₉₀. It is X₂₈₉ in that, like the Y₁₆ Y₁₇, it X₂₉₁'s


of a X₂₉₂ of X₂₉₃'s that have their own X₂

At the same


time, E A's were one of the largest F's in the US, and


G H II, the F of E, was X-ing for their support. Most A's X-ed E, partly because of its attack on


neutral  B  and  also  because  G  H  seemed  to  X


authoritarianism of the worst kind. But it wasn't until A's economy came to be X-ed by the war


that the US had any reason to choose sides. The US had been in a recession,


and E-B purchases of A military supplies pulled it out ofthat recession, giving the US a reason to want to support the Allies. E


also needed A military supplies and would have purchased them, but


the B used her navy to cut off all commerce between E and the


US. A. In any case, the upshot was that the US had a vibrant trade


with B and F and had no trade with E, giving the US a


practical  reason  to  side  with  the  former. Thanks  to  B  propaganda,


A citizens were unaware of B's treachery in this context. Largely  because  the  US  was  providing  the  Allies  with  military


supplies, E began to attack A vessels. This stirred up anti-


E sentiment among A citizens,. Thanks to propaganda, much


of it B, A citizens did not know that E was merely trying


to prevent the delivery of military supplies that would be used against it. Thanks also to largely B propaganda, they also didn't know that had


severed all commercial ties between the US and E, thereby severing


good  will  between  those  two  nations. In  any  case,  E  attacks  on


A vessels, especially the sinking of the L in 1915, fueled anti-


E sentiment among the A public. W continued to urge neutrality. But the A public began


to  turn  against  him  and  he  was  becoming  increasingly  unpopular. Also,


public figures, most notably former President T R, ridiculed


W  for  being  a  'coward'  who  was  unwilling  to  stand  up  to  Eaggression. There were two key events that caused W to finally change his


position. First, there was the 'Z Telegram.' This was a telegram


sent by E Foreign Minister A Z to M, in which, in


exchange  for  M's  help,  he  promised  to  help  M  reclaim  the


territories  that  it  had  lost  in  the  previous  century  to  the  United  States. Second,


E  sunk  a  number  of  unarmed  A  passenger  ships,  killing


hundreds of A civilians. At this point, W could no longer remain neutral without losing all


political credibility. So he sought a declaration of War from Congress, his


pitch being that war with E was necessary to "make the world safe for


democracy."  The  justification  for  this  pitch  was  that  E  was  an


autocracy whereas the Allies were for the most part democracies. Congress


granted W's request for a declaration of War. The actual cause of the US's going to war was W's realizing that


to save political face he had to go to war with E. Nonetheless, there


were  good  reasons  why  it  was  in  the  US's  interest  to  go  to  War  with


E. As previously indicated, the US benefited from the War. More


precisely, the sale of A munitions to the Allies gave strength and


vitality  to  the  previously  stagnant  A  economy. Granting  that  the


primary cause of the US's going to war was W's need to salvage whatwas left of his political reputation, A economic dependence on the


sale of munitions to the Allies may have made A's as well as their


elected  officials  more  receptive  to  the  prospect  of  going  to  war  with


E. Also,  there  was,  as  previously  mentioned,  at  least  some  reason  to


regard  E  as  a  threat  to  national  security. After  all,  E  had


attacked A vessels and it had also indicated that it might want to


collude with M to strip the US of much of her territory. But in actuality


E  was  not  a  real  threat  to  the  United  States,  and  most  A


decision-makers probably knew this. E is very far from the United


States  and  at  the  time  it  did  not  have  either  the  force  structure  or  the


technology necessary to mount a meaningful assault on the United States---


all of which would have been known to A decision-makers. As for


the Z Telegram, this did not constitute a prima facie threat to the


United States. But it is extremely unlikely that M would have taken


E up on its offer (supposing that it even was a serious offer) and


equally unlikely that E, already seriously overextended, could have


been of any use to M---all of which A decision-makers surely


knew. Nonetheless,  between  the  Z  Telegram  and  the  numerous


E attacks on A vessels, E was appropriately seen as an


adversary, and the US did therefore have something to gain by this threat toitself. Just before the US entered the war, the allies were about to sign a


peace treaty that was largely favorable to E. In effect, they were about


to  surrender. Thanks  to  A  involvement  in  the  War,  the  Allies


ultimately won. In 1919, the Allies and the Central Powers signed the now


infamous Treaty of V, the terms of which were exceedingly punitive


towards E. E delegates to the peace talks were shocked at how


severe the terms of the treaty were towards E and also how different


the terms of the treaty were from the term proposed by the Allies when the


armistice that concluded the war was first being negotiated. But the Allies did


not allow E to negotiate any of the terms, and the Treaty was signed


by all parties present. The Treaty of V demanded that E pay damages to the


Allies in the amount of $33 billion, which it simply was not possible for


E  to  do  and  which  E  could  not  even  try  to  do  without


hobbling its own economy. The Treaty also included provisions preventing


E from having a military of scale and therefore preventing it from


defending itself against aggression. The  Treaty  also  included  a  provision  to  the  effect  that  all  of  the


signatories would belong to a League of Nations that prohibited its members


from encroaching on each other's territorial integrity or independence andthat  would  impose  economic  sanctions  any  member  that  resorted  to


belligerence. Not wanting the US to submit to such an arrangement, the US


Senate,  led  by  a  group  of  so-called  'irreconcilables',  refused  to  sign  the


Treaty. Even  though  there  were  compelling  reasons,  mainly  economic  in


nature, for the US to enter WWI, its decision to do so appears in hindsight to


be  misconceived. First  of  all,  even  though  the  US's  supposed  reason  for


going to war was to 'make the world safe for democracy', it had the opposite


effect. Freedom  of  speech  was  suppressed  in  the  United  States,  so  as  to


silence  voices  of  opposition  to  the  war. More  importantly,  the  Treaty  of


V  destroyed  the  E  economy  and  embittered  the  E


people. This  gave  E  an  economic  reason  as  well  as  an  emotional


incentive to remilitarize itself, which in turn disposed to E to support


H. Be it noted that in his book The Economic Consequences of Peace,


J M K predicted that the Treaty of V would cause


E to remilitarize itself under the rule of a strongman. In conclusion, the US did have legitimate reasons to fight with the


Allies  in  WWI. But,  first  of  all,  these  reasons  were  not  the  US's  actual


reasons for doing so, though they may have played a supporting role, and,


second of all, the consequences of the US's involvement in WWI, the main


one being WWII, were so disastrous (and, arguably, so predictably so) thatthe US, whatever its reasons for entering the War, was probably not acting


rationally in doing so. M and von H on Free-market Economics

              1. Power corrupts. How have authors read for the course aimed


    to ensure that government promotes the interests of the governed? In


    your answer, discuss three or more of the following authors: P,


      L, M, R, T, H, and M


 I will focus on M, M and von H. All three have the more


or less the same view (government should restrict as little as only possible,


only curtailing freedom to prevent violence), but they have it for slightly


different reasons and have different recommendations as to how to actualize


this conception of gov't. According to M, there are two threats to liberty: the government


and other people (the majority ganging up up on the minority). Freedom from


government tyranny is accomplished by dividing the government into


mutually independent branches (e.g. executive/legislative/judiciary), allowing


someone who is being oppressed by one such branch to seek relief from the


others. As for protection from the majority, M's solution is to divide


the government into Federal and local/state, which divides the people up into


a lot of little groups (different states, different counties, different cities),


which makes it hard for them to form blocks that gang up on others. Msays that pure democracy provides no protection to the minority against the


majority, but that a 'republic' does do so, a 'republic' being indirect


democracy (the people vote for representatives, and the representatives


decide specific issues: the people themselves do not decide how to deal with


specific issues). In this way, gov't protects people from itself and others and


does the people the maximum amount of good. According to M, people should be allowed as much freedom as


possible (short of being violent to each other). A major threat to this is the


tyranny of the majority. The way to protect against this is to have


'proportionate representation', meaning that if n% of the people vote for


party x, then n% of elected officials should belong to party x. So if 3% of the


people support the green party, 10% the black panther party, 23 % the


libertarian party, etc., then 3% of the members of congress should be green


party members, 10% black panther party members, etc. In this way, there is


majority rule and minority rights. According to H, the sole purpose of government should be to


allow the economy to run its course, and government's role should therefore


be limited to enforcing contracts and preventing crimes and otherwise


allowing the economy to flourish. If the government interferes with the


economy, through planning or through the outright confiscation of property,


then the economy will fail and the people will be the worse for it. Each of these authors wants the people to be protect from gov't and


from others, but have different views as to how to accomplish this. H's


view is that the economy will give people what they need, the role of gov't


being just to keep the economy alive. M and M want to protect


people from each other, but have different views as to how to do this, with


M believing the solution to be proportional representation and M


believing the solution to be a Republican form of gov't. 3. How does private property either promote or inhibit liberty in


    the works of three or more of the following authors: P, L,


      R, M, G, and M & E? According to R and M/E, the institution of


      private property leads people to exploit one another and to turn one


      another into commodities. According to L, property allows people


    to develop resources and provide for one another, thereby enhancing


      freedom. R: when people have just enough, there are no problems;


      they are nice to each other. When some people begin to have more than


      they need (surpluses), there are problems. When people start to want


      more than they personally need, they need to exploit others. And this


      means that they need strict laws in place to keep people compliant. So      property (i.e. surplus property: enough property to exchange with


      others) leads to mutual exploitation, enslavement, injustice. M/E: Private property leads people to turn each other


      into property.


Under X, Y have only as much Z as

that are to this W-ed by X-s of the Y of the Z


AA-s in BB. P C in the X CC Y-ed little


P DD of the EE-s being FF-ed, as is GG-ed by the


HH that the II JJ of those EE-s has hardly KK-ed at all.(LL M is now NN-ed OO by Y of P Q. R is only to a very S T NN-ed by such Y.)


      X Y P C UU-ed a V W for X-s


(e.g. Y, Z, AA) from the BB-s being CC-ed, which UU-ed


DD A B in C. This E-ed F


G H-s, I-ing to the J K, along with the


L-M N O-s P-ed thereby. How is Q R from S? T U


                              (V/W/X)


 


      First of all, Y is not the same Z as AA. Y is when one BB CC-s DD EE-ed by some other


FF. AA is when one BB GG-s the FF in another


DD or BB. Although AA may HH some of the II


BB's JJ-s KK-ing in the DD that is being GG-ed, it does not


necessarily do so. Also, there are many LL MM-s that NN


GG-ation can take: OO, PP, QQ, RR. (Usually the


GG-ation is either OO or PP or both.)


        Y and AA, though LL, are not mutually


SS. All Y is AA but not all AA is


Y. If BB X TT-s BB Y, either UU-ly or


VV or in some other way, but X's FF do not WW Y, the XX is a


YY of AA without Y. The ZZ AAA in BBB-CCC was just that. In DDD-ing


EEE FFF and GGG the HHH were not so much III-ing off of


pre-JJJ-ing KKK-s as they were LLL-ing new KKK-s, the same being


MMM, though probably to a NNN OOO, of PPP and QQQ


Y in RRR and SSS FFF. HHH Y Y-ing thisTTT was less about GG-ing already UUU-ing VVV-s than it was about


LLL-ing new VVV-s (which usually WWW-ed GG-ing XXX-s, albeit


YYY-s who were not ZZZ-ed into AAAA-s, at least not in the BBBB CCCC). By DDDD, HHH AA in the X Y was less about


LLL-ing new VVV-s than it was about UU-ly EEEE-ing FFFF of


pre-JJJ-ing YYY-s. (That GGGG-ed, it did HHH AAAA-IIII-ing up to a JJJJ: see


below.) In the X Y, the HHH did not really DDD D, but


they did GG it. They did this by L-ing HHH KKKK LLLL to give


HHH MMMM-s NNNN over OOOO PPPP-s of Y QQQQ-ed in D. In


RRRR to SSSS the D TTTT, so as to make VVVV to this


UUUU, the HHH WWWW-ed D with S, E-ing to XXXX S


YYYY-tion ZZZZ D. In the X CC, the AAAAA and HHH DDD-ed much of R. HHH Y, though BBBBB, was less CCCCC so than AAAAA


Y and also more DDDDD, in the EEEEE that to a greater FFFFF


than AAAAA Y T-ed to GGGGG and relatively HHHHH KKK-s. In any IIIII, both HHH and AAAAA X CC Y were more


about GG-ing pre-JJJ-ing JJJJJ-s (not AAAA-s in the BBBB CCCC of the


KKKKK, but AAAA-s of a LLLLL) and less about KK-ing new EE-s. This is


why MMMMM HHH Y T-ed to VVV-s in the New NNNNN whose


OOOOO-s are to this PPPPP OO or HHH QQQQQ, whereas X YRRRRR and AAAAA Y hardly SSSSS-ed the II JJ of


R at all. X Y HHH AA TTTTT UU-ed A


B in C, by LLL-ing a UUUUU W for X-s VV-ed from


the VVV-s being GG-ed (e.g. Z, Y, AA), which in turn E-ed


G H, thereby I-ing WWWWW to the J K. Was the US a XXXXX YYYYY Between ZZZZZ-AAAAAA? BBBBBB CCCCCC


                                    (V/W)


 


      The U.S. has been the XXXXX YYYYY since WW2. The DDDDD EEEEEE was


also a YYYYY Y-ing the FFFFFF-s ZZZZZ-AAAAAA, mainly because it had a GGGGGG


OO and was HHHHH IIIIII in its JJJJJJ-s to bring under VVV-s


under its QQ NNNN. But the DDDDD EEEEEE had an KKKKKK KKK and


it L-ed what LLLLL MMMMMM it had into its OO, the XX being that it


NNNNN-ed  in  OOOOOO  and  now  PPPPP-s  to  what  QQQQQ  R-ed  to  as  "the


RRRRR SSSSS of V." By DDDD, the U.S. still has the most GGGGGG


KKK in the XXXXX and, although other AAAA-s (mainly TTTTT, UUUUU, and


D) are VVV-ing as WWWWW XXXXX YYYYY-s, the U.S.'s XXXXX YYYYY-ZZZZZ


AAA-ed relatively BBBBB. This CCCCC will DDDDD the EEEEE just FFFF-ed


and  to  this  GGGGG  will  HHHHH  the  IIIII  JJJJJ,  the  KKKKK  LLLLL,  the


MMMMM NNNNN, and the OOOOO between PPPPP and QQQQQ to


show that U.S. was the RRR YYYYY over the DDDDD-s. Be it SSSSS-ed that the


OOOOO between PPPPP and QQQQQ was both PP and OO


in TTTTT: it was a OOOOO between UUU-ing VVVV-s as to the WWWW XXXX of


YYYYY and the ZZZZZ of AAAAA R and BBBB CCCCC. But


this OOOOO, though DDDDD EEEE, FFFF GGGG, E-ing to a


HHHH IIII 'JJJJ war' between the U.S. and the DDDDD EEEEEE and also KKKK-ingLLLL wars by MMMM, NNNN-ing the OOOO War and the PPPP War. After XXXXX War II, and to some QQQQ because of it, two VVV-s


RRR-ed as the XXXXX's SSSS TTTT-s: the UUUU VVVV-s and the DDDDD EEEEEE. Not only were these two AAAA-s the most GGGGGG YYY-s in WWWW; they


were  also  XXXX  YYYY. This  was  OO  because  the  UUUU


VVVV-s was (and still is) a QQQQQ VVV whereas the DDDDD EEEEEE was


PPPPP. A QQQQQ VVV is YYY in which AAAAA JJ-s are ZZZZ-ed


to O R and to AAAA with each other. A PPPPP VVV is YYY


in  which  AAAAA  JJ-s  do  not  O  AAAAA  R,  at  least  not  on  a


BBBB  CCCC,  and  are  not  ZZZZ-ed  to  AAAA  with  each  other. In  a


PPPPP VVV, the YYYYY O-s DDDD, and what FF EEE


is  FFFF-ed  by  YYYYY  GGGG,  not  by  HHHH-IIII-s. In  a  QQQQQ


VVV, what FF EEE is FFFF-ed by HHHH IIII-s. Therefore PPPPP


and QQQQQ cannot JJJJ. As  soon  as  XXXXX  War  II  KKKK-ed,  the  DDDDD  EEEEEE  LLLL-ed


IIIIII. It did not MMMM take over other VVV-s. Instead, it N-ed


set up PPPPP OOOO-s in those VVV-s, which would be PPPP to the


DDDDD  EEEEEE  and  through  which  the  DDDDD  EEEEEE  could  NNNN  those


VVV-s. The DDDDD EEEEEE QQQQ RRR-ed in SSSS-ing up PPPPP


OOOO-s,  all  of  them  PPPP  to  the  DDDDD  EEEEEE,  in  all  of  TTTT  C,


NNNN-ing a V UUUU of E, and after a WWWW FFFF-s, it N-ed VVVV


PPPPP XXXX in D. The DDDDD-s had a V OO and a WWWW-YYYY-ed and also WWWW-


ZZZZ-ed  AAAA,  but  their  KKK  was  almost  BBBB  non-


CCCC. By DDDD, the UUUU VVVV-s not only had a GGGGGG OO


but a EEEE-ing KKK and a FFFF GGGG HHHH of IIII. In


JJJJ, the UUUU VVVV-s had the XXXXX's KKKK KKK (and still does), while


the DDDDD KKK was S LLLL to its AAAA and also in XXXXX


MMMM-s. (The KKK-s of NNNN, E, and OOOO E were all KKKK


than the DDDDD KKK.)


      Also, even though the DDDDD EEEEEE had a GGGGGG OO, it was


only PPPP to pay for its OO by QQQQ-ing the RRRR of its KKK. This is


why the DDDDD EEEEEE simply NNNNN-ed in OOOOOO, along with most of the other


PPPPP OOOO-s in the XXXXX. This is also why the DDDDD EEEEEE was so


IIIIII SSSS: it had no KKK and therefore had to TTTT on


other KKK-s, which it did up to a JJJJ but which the USA UUUU-ed in


VVVV VVV-s and which it therefore was not PPPP to do WWWW. The DDDDD-s' XXXX led to the so-YYY-ed MMMMM NNNNN, this


being  the  US's  ZZZZ  to  AAAA  the  DDDDD  EEEEEE  from  BBBB-ing


CCCC  VVV-s  into  the  DDDDD  DDDD. The  MMMMM  NNNNN  EEEE


FFFF into WWWW in GGGG when HHHH MMMMM IIII-ed to JJJJ in


GGGG that he would KKKK the JJJJJJ the DDDDD-s were then LLLL-ing to MMMML PPPPP NNNN YYYY-s in OOOOO and PPPPP. The US's QQQQ


JJJJJJ-s to RRRR DDDDD (and, more SSSS, PPPPP) TTTT were


not always UUUU (though they were VVVV BBBB UUUU),


but the very JJJJ that the US FFFF-ed those WWWW-s and thus FFFF-ed it so XXXX for


the DDDDD-s to LLLL FFFF-ed the U.S. a YYYY and therefore a YYYYY of


AAAA-s. The OOOOO between the US and USSR was in V ZZZZ a 'JJJJ


war', AAAA-ing that it did not HHH BBBB, MMMM CCCC OOOOO-s between


those two TTTT-s. But the so-YYY-ed 'JJJJ' War WWW-ed a DDDD of 'EEEE'


(FFFF) wars-by-


X Y was one of the first Z's of the A B,


which, though not technically C-ed by any one D, was largely the


E of the F and G. The H of the A B is to I


J-ing K's, mainly by L-ing them M's but also by N-ing


them with O. After the P Q, X Y R-ed S to


T its U-ed V, and the A B W-ed it the X-ed


Y's, Z-ing X Y's AA the BB that it is


today. Meanwhile, CC Y DD-ed on EE and FF GG's, still


HH-ing on the II, and its AA is JJ. Whereas EE KK had only one LL to it - a MM and NN


LL - F KK had two LL's to it: an OO-EE and sometimes PP


LL and a QQ-PP, RR LL. The RR LL SS-ed


the F's being an TT UU, which it VV WW by simply XX a


YY  AA  and  which  it  VV  WW  by  ZZ-ing  AAA  TT


BBB to other CCC's, which it still VV's and which it first DDD EE-ingwith the FFF of the GGG HHH. The GGG HHH was an III on the F's JJJ to KKK LLL


in the MMM of NNN. The HHH of the GGG was to OOO the


PPP-ed  QQQ's  of  LLL  by  RRR-ing  and  SSS-ing  TTT,


UUU-ing VVV-WWW's between XXX's, YYY-ing ZZZ between and


within the XXX's of LLL, and AAAA-ing the BBBB of CCCC. To


this  DDDD,  the  F  EEEE-ed  FFFF's  of  its  own  GGGG's  in  the  QQQ's  of


LLL. The F HHHH-ed to IIII the JJJJ's of the GGG HHH to the


EE KKKK, but the II LLLL-ed and also MMMM-ed the F's NNNN's to


IIII such JJJJ's to OOOO and PPPP. LLL's AA, especially the QQQ's of the CCC's QQQQ-ed


by  the  GGG  HHH,  RRRR-ed  in  the  SSSS's  TTTT-ing  NNN,  and  it  is


UUUU-ly  VVVV  that  GGG  HHH  had  a  WWWW  in  this. Also,  the


QQQ's that were not QQQQ-ed the by GGG HHH, mainly the CCC's


in the EE XXXX, did not YYYY. So ZZZZ-ing that the EE KKKK was a


AAAAA BBBBB of a CCCCC after NNN, it did not did not use its BBBBB in a DDDDD


that EEEEE-ed either its own FFFFF's or those of other CCC's. By GGGGG,


the HHHHH IIIII did use its BBBBB JJJJJ-ly, at least in many KKKKK's


(though obviously not all), and it did not have to LLLLL its own AA to


either have or MMMMM that BBBBB. A NNNNN OOOOO the GGGGG between PPPPP BBBBB and EE wasthe QQQQQ RRRRR. After NNN, SSSSS over the TTTTT of QQQQQ was UUUUU-ed


between four BBBBB's: LLL, G, F, and EE KKKK. In VVVVV, in an


WWWWW  to  XXXXX  YYYYY  SSSSS  of  QQQQQ,  the  EE  KKKK  ZZZZZ-ed  off


AAAAAA,  BBBBBB  and  CCCCCC  DDDDDD  to  the  EEEEEE  of  the  TTTTT  under  FFFFFF-EE


SSSSS. The F GGGGGG-ed by HHHHHH-ing much IIIIII-ed JJJJJJ's into those


KKKKKK's. For LLLLLL of MMMMMM-ing an all-out NNNNNNN with the F, the EE's did not try


to  OOOOOO  these  PPPPPP  JJJJJJ's  from  QQQQQQ-ing  in  and  eventually  RRRRRR-ed  off,


SSSSSSS-ing the up the TTTTTTT-UUUUUUU that it had originally ZZZZZ-ed off. The QQQQQ


RRRRR, along with the F's GGGGGG to it, VVVVVV-ed the EE's WWWWWW like


XXXXXXX YYYYYYY's and VVVVVV-ed the F WWWWWW like a ZZZZZZZ. In VVVVV, the EE's AAAAAAA-ed a BBBBBBB-ly CCCCCCC-ed DDDDDDD in


EEEEEEE and FFFFFFF-ed a GGGGGGGG HHHHHHH IIIIIII's. This was but one


of many JJJJJJJ's of EE KKKKKKK in the LLLLLLL MMMMMMM of NNN,


the NNNNNNN in QQQQQ being another, and PPPPP and other OOOOOOO PPPPPPP's


were  QQQQQQQ-ed,  RRRRRRR-ing  to  the  SSSSSSS  in  VVVVV  of  TTTTTTTT  (UUUUUUU  VVVVVVV


WWWWWWW XXXXXXX), this being a YYYYYYY of OOOOOOO ZZZZZZZ's that AAAAAAA-ed to


BBBBBBB as one if the EE's CCCCCCC-ed DDDDDDD-ly EEEEEEE given any one of them. The  FFFFFFF  GGGGGGG's  of  TTTTTTTT  were HHHHHHH, G, IIIIIII, JJJJJJJ,


LLL, KKKKKK, LLLLLLL, MMMMMMM, the NNNNNNN, OOOOOOO, PPPPPPP and


the HHHHH IIIII. Although TTTTTTTT was SSSSSSS-ed largely in QQQQQQQ to RRRRRRR


EE KKKKKKK, it had a SSSSSSS TTTTTTTT, this being to I UUUUUUU ZZZZZZZ'sI one another through VVVVVVV's. And so it is that TTTTTTTT still WWWWWWW's, even


though the EE KKKK XXXXXXX long ago, and as of YYYYYYY YYYYYYY's PPPP,


OOOO and EEEEEEE, all ZZZZZZZ GGGGGGG's of the EE XXXX. Was the F a AAAAA PPPPPPP between AAAAAAA-BBBBBBB? CCCCCCC. It DDDDDDD-ed the AAAAA


EEEEEEE-ly, in that it had the AAAAA's most FFFFFFF EEEEEEE and also GGGGGGG-ed it to


HHHHHHH  against  EE  and  EE-IIIIIII-ed  JJJJJJJ. It  DDDDDDD-ed  the  AAAAA


TTTTTTT-ly, in that it had the AAAAA's KKKKKKK and most LLLLLLL AA. And  because  it  it  MMMMMMM-ed  (sometimes  NNNNNNN-ly)  to  use  its  TT  and


EEEEEEE OOOOOOOO for PPPPPPP, the F was in some QQQQQQQ's a 'RRRRRRR' AAAAA PPPPPPP


during this SSSSSSS-TTTTTTT. The EE's were AAAAA PPPPPPP's only in the UUUUUUU that


they had a FFFFFFF EEEEEEE. Moreover, when the EE's did UUUUUUU, they did


so VVVVVVV-ly: under WWWWWWW they XXXXXXX-ed XX,XXX,XXX of their own YYYYYYY's


and  ZZZZZZZ-ed AAAAAAA's more in BBBBBBB's (CCCCCCC DDDDDDD's); they EEEEEEE-ed


FFFFFFF GGGGGGG-hhh HHHHHH in IIIIIII, who himself IIIIIII-ed (or JJJJJJ-ed to the KKKKKKK of)


AAAAAAA's of his own. GGGGGGG, in his LLLLLL, EEEEEEE-ed MMMMMMM NNNNNNN NNN in OOOOOOO


who,  during  PPPPPPP-QQQQQQQ,  IIIIIII-ed  R  SSSSSSS  TTTTTTT's,  out  of  a  UUUUUUU


VVVVVVV of V,VVV,VVV. When the F did UUUUUUU, which it often did (and


probably still VV's), it was not out of a WWWWWW to XXXXXXX other CCC's but


out of a YYYYYYY to ZZZZZZZ how to I them AAAAAAAA-ly. So CCCCCCC--the F was not


only a AAAAA PPPPPPP during this BBBBBBBB but the AAAAA PPPPPPP, with the EE's


being a rather CCCCCCC DDDDDD. A EEEEEEE for FFFFFFF GGGGGGG and against HHHHHHH IIIIIII's


(JJJJJJJ/KKKKKKK)


 


      I would not LLLLLLL MMMMMMM-ing NNNNNNN FFFFFFF OOOOOOO's with


a HHHHHHH IIIIIII. The PPPPPP is that QQQQQQQ-and-RRRRRR SSSSSS's are not for the TTTTTTT


UUUUUUU to VVVVVV. It is not for the TTTTTTT UUUUUUU to VVVVVV whether WWWWWWW-


XXXXXXX-ing YYYYYYYY should be ZZZZZZZ-ed, since the JJJJJJJ AAAAAAAAA's BBBBBBB


because  of  CCCCCCC-WWWWWWW  OOOOOOO's  are  DDDDDDD  EEEEEEE-ed  to  the


FFFFFFF GGGGGGGG's thereby HHHHHHH-ed. A IIIIIII's JJJJJJJ not to have to


KKKKKK LLLLLLL MMM is not as NNNNNNN as a OOOOOOO's JJJJJJJ to have PPPPPPP

      [XX]
QQQQQQ. Those  who  RRRRRRR  MMMMMMM-ing  FFFFFFF  OOOOOOO's  with  a


HHHHHHH IIIIIII SSSSSS that TTTTTTT UUUUUU JJJJJJJ VVVVVVV's not to WWWWWW will

                                                                                        [XX]
do as much to XXXXXXX WWWWWWW as YYYYYYY or ZZZZZZZ-ing UUUUUU who WWWWWW. This is AAAAAAA-ed. If UUUUU ZZZZZZZ they'll be YYYYYYY-ed or go to BBBBBBB if they


WWWWWW, they won't WWWWWW. If UUUUU ZZZZZZZ they CCCCCCC to DDDDDDD EEEEEEE by


WWWWWW-ing  less,  they  may  WWWWWW  less---or  they  may  not. The  FFFFFFF-GGGGGGG

                                          [XX]
HHHHHHH here is extremely IIIIIII. JJJJJJJ what a given IIIIIII CCCCCCC's


to  KKKKKK  by  WWWWWW-ing  may  LLLLLLL  what  it  has  to  pay  in  HHHHHHH  IIIIIII's. Or


JJJJJJJ  new  IIIIIII  MMMMMMM's  might  NNNNNNN  that  OOOOOOO  PPPPPPP's  to  QQQQQQ  off


HHHHHHH IIIIIII's. If RRRRRRR's ZZZZZZZ that they will be ZZZZZZZ-ed for WWWWWW-ing, theywill not WWWWWW. But if WWWWWWW simply SSSSSSS's more TTTTTTT-ing UUUUUUU's


and may even VVVVVV to WWWWWWW EEEEEEE of some XXXXXXX, they may WWWWWW. Many will YYYYYYY that the ZZZZZZZ between AAAAAAA CCCCCCC BBBBBBB's-


--between DDDDDD's of 'EEEEEEE DDDDDDD' (FFFFFFF-ed by the GGGGGGG-HHHHHHH


IIIIIII-ers) and those who JJJJJJ 'KKKKKKK DDDDDDD' (FFFFFFF-ed by the LLLLLLL-HHHHHHH

      [XX]
IIIIIII-ers). This is a MMMMMMM and NNNNNNN OOOOOO of PPPPPPP-ing the QQQQQQ. Even


those  who  RRRRRRR  SSSSSSS  DDDDDDD  TTTTTTT  that  DDDDDDD  should


UUUUUUU when the very VVVVVVV of the WWWWWW-ed is at XXXXXXX, as it is where


YYYYYYY's ZZZZZZ-ing to the AAAAAAA of the BBBBBB are CCCCCCC-ed, and the KKKKKKK


DDDDDDD/EEEEEEE DDDDDDD ZZZZZZZ therefore only DDDDDD's YYYYYYY's that are


EEEEEEE  FFFFFFF. The  GGGGGGG  HHHHHHH  of  IIIIIII  and  JJJJJJ  use  KKKKKK  a


LLLLLLL's RRRRRRR MMMMMM but not its very NNNNNNN, this being why it is 'KKKKKKK


DDDDDDD' to OOOOOOO them and 'EEEEEEE DDDDDDD' to PPPPPP them. But


QQQQQQ  RRRRRRR's  of  WWWWWWW do SSSSSSS  a  LLLLLLL's  very  NNNNNNN. TTTTTTT-ly, a DDDDDDD


.X-ed it to


be the case—and thus X-ed it to be the case—that our Y's should Z


our W to V, because he could U that T S would R


Q P." (O 3) At the same time, as this same N


M's, O L's that K's J and I are


H not so much in what we are in what we could be: it is up to us to


V the J and I that, in O's G, K


F-ed in us. Though a E in K and D in that C, O


B A of Ω Z, Y-ing it as "X than a W", (169)her V being that the main U of Ω Z to be a


kind of T "S to...R's, whose Q P O the


N of the M L, is not yet K-ed and won't be for a J


I."(38) O H's to G that 'Z' is F when it is


about the E of D but not when it is about C in an


B. O A's to G that Z (of the F, Ω-


Ψ Ξ) will Z Y S, Υ because it X's Τ


more J and Σ Ρ-ed: "Π would K Ο us from Ν of


ourselves to the Μ Λ's Κ-ed by the Ι of his Θ


and I, if these Η's weren't Ζ-ed so as to Ε our Δ

Ξ? Υ Τ-ed that no Σ Ρ's in the Π that K didn't


Ο to Ν, I Μ my Λ on the Κ of K." (4) As this Ι


Η's, O Ζ's K as a Ε by Δ-ing whom we


Γ ourselves. When it comes to Ω Z, Β and O are in


Α Ψ. Both Ξ Ω Z's as Υ and Τ


and as Σ-ing the Ρ of what they Π to be Σ-ing. But even here Β


and O are not in Ο Ψ. O doesn't


Ξ Ω Z as Υ Τ. She Σ's to Ρ that ifZ's were Π Ο, they would Ν what they Μ-ed to Ν. By


Λ, Β Ξ's Ω Z as Υ Τ, his V


being that a 'Π-Ο' Z Σ Ρ's a Ν Π than a Μ Ο


Z of Λ-ing Κ. When it comes to Z in Ι, Β and O don't


Θ at all. O Η's that Z is Υ Ι, while


Ζ-ing that it can be Υ-ed. Β Η's that a Z cannot Ε


be Ι, since a Z is Σ a Δ of Γ-ing the Β's with Α


Ω's about Ψ's and other such Ξ. For Β, Z is Σ to be


Υ-ed, his Τ being that "Σ", which he Ρ's to be the

Z, and all Η, instead of Ζ-ing them on a new Ε." For


O, Z is not to be Υ-ed Δ-ed from its Υ


Γ Β's. Thus Α-ed, O Ω's, it will Ψ as a

Ρ the Π the Ο of Ν. Μ Λ's vs. Κ Ι's (Θ/Η)




      I would Ζ in Ε of the Μ Λ, and I would Ν so because it

that I will now Θ, it would Μ the Λ because it would Μ


the Κ, not despite its Η-ing so. According to the Ζ Ε


of both Δ's and Γ's, the Λ can only Β at the


Α of Ω Ψ. Because Γ's Ξ this and also Υ

Δ's Ξ this and do not Θ the Γ Β's of Ε,


they  Θ  the Γ  Ω  Β's  of Λ  Α. Both Ψ's are Ξ-ed. Υ Τ Σ Ρ's Π the


Λ. (One can Ο whether Ι Θ is a Η, but not


whether  Ζ-ing  Ε's  into  Δ  and  Γ  Β's  and  Β  Α's


Ω.)  Ψ-Ξ  Α's  Σ  do  Υ  the  Κ's


Τ, since they Σ it Ρ for new Π's to Ο into


Ν's, Μ Λ-ing Κ's to Ι's Θ's to Η Ζ Ε's, and


also Δ to Ι-ed Γ's. Μ Λ's are Β-ed to Μ Α: the more Τ Α Μ, the


more they are Λ-ed. This Κ's Ι-Θ Η. When ΙΖ's are too Ε, Τ Δ how to Γ. They Δ not to Β the

Σ Υ Τ Σ's (e.g. they can Ρ not to Β the Π on


when they Ο for Ν). Second, the Μ of Λ-ing in an Ι-Θ


Η  will  be  Ζ  Ε,  Δ  with  Μ  Λ's,  Γ-ing


Β's to Α and Γ-ing Ψ's to Σ the Ξ-ed Υ's. Third, many Τ can Σ such Ρ's. Of course, Ε Ι-Ζ's

Α: Ψ a Ξ between Δ, Ζ, Υ, and


Γ. Δ can be Β-ed of as Α Ψ-ing Γ. What we


do Ξ when we Υ to 'Δ'? What Τ Σ's to Ρ is


Ο Ν, Μ, Λ, Κ and the like. Of course, the Ι


'Δ' Θ Η's to the Ζ's and Ε's that Δ the


Γ's of a Β Α of Τ. This is what is Ξ when Τ


Σ that in Ρ 'Δ', it is Π-ed Ο to Ν a Μ. But


these two Λ's of the Ι 'Δ' are Κ-ed: Ρ Λ and Ν


Ι to Θ the same Ζ's that Δ Γ's among Ρ


Τ, the same being Σ of Ρ Δ and Ο Δ. In Ι,


the 'Δ' of a Β Τ is the Γ Α that Ψ's Ξ to the


Υ Ζ's, Ε's, and Γ Β's that Α them in their


Ψ's with one another. The Ξ Υ of Δ, Τ, is


Γ, with the Σ that it Ρ's Π—not as a Ο of


a Ν Μ on Λ's Κ to Ι some Θ, but as a


Η Ζ-Ε of Γ's between Τ. Because the Σ of Γ Ρ-ed in Δ Π's up beingΘ-ed in Ι-Κ Ε's and Γ's, it Β's to Α


what it is Π-ed Ο for Ν's to Μ on their own and it


therefore Β's to Α Ζ. Whereas Δ Υ's Τ and


Σ, Ζ is the Ρ of a Ν Π on an


Ν's Κ to Ι his Γ Τ's to Ρ some Θ. The


Η was an Ζ. Λ Ε-ed it with the Ν


Μ of Κ-ing a Θ. The same is Σ of the Ρ Π. By


Ο, Ν Μ Λ's were not Ζ's. They were


Κ, and they were the Ι's of Γ and Σ Α. But


they did not Ψ into Ξ because of some Ν's Μ to


Ι some Θ. Even though many Ν Λ's of Θ-Κ


were Ι-ed in Γ-ing them, the Μ to Β them was not itself


Α-Ψ-ed, and instead Ξ-ed Τ out of Σ Ρ,


Π Ε's and Ο's. Υ is Ψ. Ν's Υ, and so do Ξ's of


Τ. A Σ Υ-ed Ν is one who has Ρ-ed his Π


Ο's, and a Σ Υ-ed Κ or Ι is one that has Θ its


Υ Η's, Ζ-ing the Ε's of the Ν's Δ-ing it, to


Γ Α. Υ can be Β-ed of as the Α of a Ψ Ξ


out of an Τ one: an Σ is Ξ Β-ed, as it were, out of a Ρ; an


Π-ed Ι is Ξ Β-ed out of one that is Ψ. AlthoughΥ can be the Ξ of Ν Μ, as when a


Τ Σ Ρ's to Υ his Ε's as a Δ, it Β's to


Α Τ: no Ν Μ is Ρ-ed in a Ο's


Υ-ing into a Ν. In any Σ, Υ, unlike other Ρ's of


Γ, is Π in Ο. When an Ν Υ's into an Σ, the


Ρ Π, as it were, is the Ν, and the Ο-ed Ι is the Σ.


And this X G brings us to an E G about the American

R. The American R isn't Ω about being able to Z up

within some pre-existing Θ Λ. It is also about being able to change

that Λ. Bill Gates came from a well-to-do M. He could have just

T-ed his Π at Harvard and more or less just Φ-ed, working as a

computer scientist or financier. But he didn't just Φ; he invented a new

product—nay, a new kind of product: the personal computer. And he didn't

just invent that product: he made it available to literally billions of people for

a modest price. I don't know what Bill Gates' personal motivations were in doing this,

but the effect of his actions was to make life easier and better. Right now, in

writing this very essay, I am using the operating system that he invented and

also made available for a modest price. And it is very likely that in reading

this essay, you too are using these same inventions. Bill Gates is not alone in this. Think about todays' IT and tech-giants:

Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, Sergei Brin, Larry Page, Jeff Bezos. All of

these people are Americans, either by birth or by naturalization, and all of

them chose to 'set up shop', as it were, in the United States. Why did they make this choice? Because this country is hospitable to

big ideas and to big innovations. It is hospitable in a purely logistical, as in,

the laws of this country do not discourage it even encourage it, there being,

for example, tax-breaks for start-ups along with government-sponsored

business-education programs. And there is also a special 'place', as it were,

in the American psyche for somebody who strikes out on his own and tries to

'make it big.' People are people, no matter where you go; and people tend to

respond two novelty with suspicion and they tend to respond to successful

upstarts with envy and fear. And granting that Americans are by no means an

exception to this, there is a value that all Americans seem to have internalized

to the effect that 'all bets are off'---that there is to be a suspension of all of

the usual pettiness and resentment that is usually directed towards people

who are trying to make something of themselves; that such people are to be

'given a break' and allowed to follow their dreams. So if somebody suddenly

quits his job as phone-salesperson in order to start a company, he is not

ridiculed or hassled for doing so. It is understood that, business being what it

is, may not succeed, at least not initially. But over and above the difficulties

that are inherent in starting a business, he is not thwarted for doing so. A related point is that in this country, to a much greater degree than in

other countries, people are given a second chance—and a third, and a fourth. In fact, the whole concept of the second chance is a distinctively Americanconcept. This country is about giving people second chances, in business and

in life in general. Think about the late Anthony Bourdain. At the age of 45,

Bourdain was, in his own words, "basically a fry cook." And then he boldly

quit his fry cook job and started a career as a combination of explorers, chef,

and cyber-preneur. Before 'breaking out', Bourdain had had a decidedly

checkered and uneven career, having numerous battles with substance abuse

and other personal demons. But despite it all, he had his intellect, his

creativity, and his boldness; and he not only succeeded in making money, but

succeeded in re-inventing a tired industry. This country's history is replete with Anthony Bourdain's---with

people who were on the precipice of financial and emotional disaster but

who, at the last minute, pulled themselves together. Let us not forget that

Harlan ('Colonel') Sanders was 65 when he opened his first Kentucky Fried

Chicken Restaurant. I would not go so far as to say that at the moment I embody the

American R. But I aspire to embody it. I want to become a dentist. I

have always wanted to become a dentist. People ask me 'Why do you want to

become a dentist, Jonathan?' And I have no ready response. I honestly

believe that, just as certain people are cut out for finance and others for the

military, so some people really want to help others by fixing their teeth. I

believe that an interest dentistry is a specific evolutionary deviation---thatsuch an interest pre-dates tens of thousands of years the existence of dentistry

in anything like its modern form


      In any case, given my passion for dentistry, it is clear how I need the

American R to come through for me: I need the opportunity to learn the

craft of dentistry; I need to learn how to help people as a dentist; and I

therefore need to attend the possible schools and programs. And the

American R is coming through for me in that respect. Because I have

worked so hard at my classes and been rewarded with correspondingly high

grades, it is overwhelmingly likely that I will have the privilege of being

accepted to one of the prestigious institutions to which, in pursuit of my own

private American R of becoming a dentist, I am seeking admittance


                     Knowledge-capital (Politics/Economics/Philosophy)


 


      In today's world, property is important, but knowledge is more

important than property. Suppose that Person A has unlimited

knowledge/intelligence but no property, and suppose that Person B has

property but little to no intelligence or knowledge. Person A can probably

acquire property; in fact, there is little limit to how much property he can

acquire. And once Person A has property, there is little or no limit how much

he can make it grow. By contrast, the best Person B can do is hold his

position: he can hold onto the property that he has but (setting aside blind

luck) cannot make it grow. In a market economy, anyone who can figure out

a way to satisfy market demands is able to add to his holdings, and it is

knowledge, and knowledge alone, that enables one to be able to satisfy

market-demands. In a feudal economy or a command economy, property seldom passes

from one person to another, tending to remain fixed. Such economies are not

dynamic, and participants in such economies, having as they do little way to

improve their lot, focus more on property-retention than on property-

acquisition. In such an economy, it doesn't pay to invest in one's own

education, since there is no guarantee that one will be in a position to market

one's education. But in a market-economy, there is such a guarantee, since insuch an economy one can always find a way to trade knowledge or skill for

property. This is why since the beginning of the Enlightenment, one's stature in

society has come to depend increasingly on one's own abilities, including

intellectual abilities, and decreasingly on the social position that one

happened to be born into. A market economy is an Enlightenment (or,

technically, post-Enlightenment economy), and in such an economy one's

ability to acquire property, and even sometimes just to retain, depends largely

one's abilities, especially one's intellectual abilities. Kant published his paper "What is Enlightenment?" in 1784. The

Enlightenment was already three centuries old at that point. But it wasn't

until around this time that Enlightenment views caught up with economic

practice. During the most of the period between around 1550 to 1750, the

average citizen's ability to transact was severely restricted; in order to play a

given trade, or even engage on some specific venture within a trade that he

was already practicing, he often needed special dispensations from

government officials or from guilds. This was beginning to change in the

mid-1700's. As a result, the average citizen was increasingly able, and

increasingly obligated, to stake his own claim in the market-place. Given that markets were beginning to be free when Kant wrote his

essay, individuals had to start being self-reliant or, to use Kant's term,'autonomous.' In a truly free market, nothing is permanent. Institutions come

and go, depending on what consumers want. Under such circumstances, the

individual cannot rely on fixed institutions or indeed on anything other than

his own ability. This means that people have to decide for themselves how

their lives will be. And this is one of the main points of Kant's essay, as its

opening words make clear:


 


        "Enlightenment is man's emergence from his self-imposed nonage. Nonage is the inability to use one's own understanding without another's


guidance. This nonage is self-imposed if its cause lies not in lack of


understanding but in indecision and lack of courage to use one's own mind


without another's guidance. Dare to know! (Sapere aude.) 'Have the courage


to use your own understanding,' is therefore the motto of the enlightenment."


 


      In a non-market economy, the exhortation to 'have the courage to use


your own understanding' is without operational meaning. It is well and good


to urge an indentured servant to 'think for himself', but even if he does


manage to think for himself, it won't do him any good in a practical sense. But in a market-economy that exhortation is on point, since one ultimately


has nothing to rely on in such an economy other than one's own judgment. That in turn is why general education has replaced apprenticeships asthe way of inducting people into the workforce. When the economy was less


free, professions were not constantly being improved or replaced, and one


could guarantee a living for oneself by deciding on a particular trade. Now


that the economy is free and therefore volatile, this doesn't necessarily work,


and workers, even skilled workers, are constantly having to acquire new


skills in order to earn a living. For this reason, they need the foundation of a


broad education, as opposed to an apprenticeship. Hence Daniel Allen's


statement in his article "What is Education For?":


 


      "The dominant policy paradigm attends almost exclusively to


education's vocational purpose: the goal is to ensure that young people, and


society generally, can compete in a global economy. This view is tightly


connected to a technocratic economic policy that focuses on the


dissemination of skills as a way to reduce inequality in a technology-


dependent economy."


 


      Implicit in this statement is the idea that one's financial capital


depends on one's intellectual capital. A corollary of the latter is that


intellectual capital (including access to knowledge) is at least as important as,


and in some ways more important, possession of property. There is another relevant G, namely, that in market economies, thereis an extremely high degree of specialization and there is a correspondingly


high degree of division of labor. The reason for this is that in market-


economies efficiency is reward and, as Adam Smith points out, a high-degree


of division of labor is efficient:


 


      "The greatest improvement in the productive powers of labour, and the


greater part of the skill, dexterity, and judgment with which it is any where


directed, or applied, seem to have been the effects of the division of


labour…"


 


      Being able to survive in a market-economy thus tends to involve being


able to do highly specialized work. And because market economies are


dynamic, it also tends to involve being able do a series of different


specialized kinds of work. So from the standpoint of competing in a market-


economy, what matters is not having this or that specific body of knowledge,


but is rather having the ability to acquire knowledge-on-demand. In other


words, what matters is access to knowledge, such access being the modern


version of capital. Four Essays on Modern History (History/Politics)

was not the F G. For H, I's J in K was

L about its M N being O P, and the Q R, though

S about T-ing the U V, was at W X about

Y-ing the Z with a A B of C. 2) D the E F of G during the H

the O P of Q since R? Since S, there has been a T U V from W to

C-ed to D, but it is also because as the E's F G

H I J, K-ing L of M's and a N O

'Y' and 'Z' A's, but B these C's had

D been about E F vs. G H (e.g.I's of J's K vs. L's of it), they M in the

Q. As a R of this S, there T to be U V in the

W X, and this Y Z's to A. So in this B there has been a

'C D' since E. But in F G's, the H-I J

K has L, with M N's, O P's etc. now being Q as

R and S. So in T, since U, there has been a V

W in X Y and a Z A in B and C D,

E of these being F to the G of the H I and the J of the

A B C in D since E, or has it F G to

W because X and Y Z A during that

H was I into J. But for the K L M N in

the O has been on the P. The Q R S to T, were the U of

V and W, the X Y, Z A of the

B C (which D E F's G H to I

J with one K), the L of M and, N, the

O of P Q. 4) Since R, S's have T U V-

W's X the Y, yet the Z of those A have

B over C. D an E that F the G of H

I, J, and K from L to M. N O P-ing the Q R as S as it T it in

U. The V W X Y Z A were B

C in D. Because E F G H to I the

J, it K L M-N's into O. This P the Q R S to have T U V M-W, since

X is not Y Z on the A of a B C D

E those who are F. At the G H, I J K L in M

N. In O P, Q was R about S the T

U than it was about V a W X from Y. As a

Z, the A B C was D E on F G and

H than on I and J K not be L M on the

N of one O of P by Q. In R and S

T, U, there were (and V are) W X Y who

Z be A into B (or C D). E, those F,

being G H on I (of J K) and L (M,

N, O) were P Q on R S than on T U and

V to a W X than Y Z A be B by

C D. The E in the F G was H I on the J

K, and for this L, M with the N O that P is

Q, R was S in the T in U. This V a W

but X Y of Z A B in the C D E

F of G H. During the I J, there was a K L of M and N O P of Q and R, all of which was

S T by a U V of W on their X. After Y,

and because of it, these Z A B, C because D

was in E F a G H I, and although J K to this

L, it M N in the O P, Q R S that

it T, this being U are not V W or X Y on the Z

of A. In a B, C D the E F for G, as

H as I, J to K of L such as M (N

from O in P), Q (R from S in T) and U

(V from W in X). In Y Z, A B

C D (as in E), in F it G. In G, H I J are K L. They can

M N and O can be P in Q. But R

such S T U to be V to W with X Y to be

Z to A at the B C and D at the E F, which it G to

be H to I if there are J K that L who can M their N

and O how P they can Q it for. Why is the R S so T-U? (V)


 


 


      The W X is Y-Z in two A's. B, we C

D E per F than G H I J. K, we L M

N O than P Q's, in the R that we S T U-V

per W-X. A Y of Z A's for this have been B. For

        [38]
C:


 


      (i)         There are D of E F in the G H that I

J an K L M-N O. (ii)   There are P Q R-S in the T U,

and, being V by W X-Y, Z-A are

B-C. (iii)                       D E have a F for G and they H

I: J K L-M N in the O's and P

Q in the R. (iv)   S T in the U V have W X

Y, e.g. their Z A B C on all D, the E being

that the F do not G have a H in their I-J'

being K-L. But whether M N or O, (i)-(iv) are not the P

Q why the R is so S-T. (In U, it V W that X one of

Y is Z a A.) The B is C in D. The E F is all about the the G H. And what is

the I J? It is about K in the L and M N

O by P into the Q R S. It is about T not one, but two or

U V W in the X. It is about Y a Z A B, and a C

in the D. The E F is not G about H I. It is J to

K L without M N. The O P is about Q R

by S T. The U V is also about W. And X there

is Y with this and Z that is A about it. But it has B to C

in D is that one is E as a F in the G H if one I the

J. K, no one is L M and N as a O than P

who 'Q to R the S', T of U his V W.


And no one is X-ed as more of a Y than somebody who Z's an W X—not an

V X, which is almost X-ed as a Q of R, but a S-T,

like the $85,000 U V, which is one quarter as W as a X

Y, but also—and perhaps partly for that reason---has around four times

as much Z A. B C is about D-ing it. And D-ing it is E-ed with

D-ing more F. And the most G H's that one has I-ed

F tend J K L's---large M-ed N's,

S-T-ing O's and P's, long Q R's to the S, and

so on. Whereas an T U like V or W is about X, the

Y Z is about A's and B C. And B

C, at least as D-ed by most E, is about "F

G", to use H I's J. And it is the

K B L of C with M—with

F G, in other N—that the O of B

P-Q R. S's T vs. U's T (V/W)

 

 

      X's Y is Z in some A B's to C's. Let us D by

E-ing what F did. G

 

      H was the I J of the K L form 1923-1953. M had two N's: He O-ed to P Q R S as T

as U, and he also V-ed to W onto X. These two Y's of

his were Z. A is the B that C is to have any D

E (on a F G H). And so it was the I J-ed K of all of their L. The

M took N. O gave up their P, their Q, even their

R to the S. This was T not just of those in the U V, but of

W. X Y-ed Z. The A Y-ed B, and

C D-ed for the E. Given that the F G-ed H, the I was J. The K was L: it M-ed N, O-ed what kind of P

Q were to do, R-ed who would S in the T and who would be

'U', V-ed who would W and who would X, Y-ed what Z

could A, what B's they could C, and what D E's they

could F to. Thus the G H was I J K, in

the L that the M was N-ed the O of each P's Q. In the R S, all T, all U, and even all V

were W X-ed (at least, to the Y that Z of A is a

B of C of D and E). In the F G, H I-ed for the J of the K

L, and the M was N a O P Q R. A S of this T-U is that V W's

and X-Y's were Z A-ed into this B C

D. E-F G's were H-ed; all I J was

K L; all M was N O; all P Q was

R S. To the T that U or V or W X

Y from Z A, it was not B-ed. They were not C-ed

because the D E was to be a F G H, not a I

of J K L's and not, M, a N of

O P Q R. A S of T U was V

W. To some X this Y was Z-ed, being a mere

A of B C on the D of the E

F. But to a G H, it was I, being J-ed as a

K of L-ing M-N's and O-ing them into P to the Q

R. And so it was that S's T U V-ed the

W-X-ed Y-Z in the A, which B-ed the C

of 10,000,000 D's. E F is not G in the same H as I J. First

of all, K under L is a M/N-O P. (There are some

Q's on R, but they are S to those in the T

U.) But there are some V's between W's X of Y

and Z's. A

 

      First of all, B, like C, is an D-E. But whereas

F's G was a H I of his J, K's

L is about M-ing N's O P (or what Q

R's to be that S). T U's V to W the X and

Y Z's that it had before the A B; he C's D to be

E, and he F's G and H I's between J to

K to a L M N, with O P Q and

R S's about T U. (It should be V that W's

X in these Y's is Z A: There are more B

C's and D's per E in F than in the G H. And

I are not J-ed for being K in L, even though they may be M-ed

for being, as N O's it, for being P in a Q R S.)

      Also, under T, as under U, there is only V W of the

X. There are two Y's to this. First, the Z is not A-ed to B

the C of D's E. Second, the F is not to G the

H of I J and K-L within M. N, O's P is Q R only for the S of

these two T's, the first being a U not so much of V's

W as of his X Y to Z A. But B's C is D with this E to F in G. As a H, I's J is to K L to a M

N O. And as P who Q's to have R, it is in S's

T to U V to a W X. Also, Y that Z, as

A B, is the C (up to a D), there is (to that E) no

F between G-ing H in I to J, on the one

K, L-ing M in N to O, on the other P. The same was Q of R. As a S-T, U

V-ed to W X to a Y Z A. And as

B who C-ed to D onto E, it was in F's G to

H I to a J K L. And M that N was

the O P, there was to that Q no R (to that S)

between T-ing U in the V W to the X Y, on

the one Z, and A-ing B in the C D to E, on the

other. Why F G is H

 

      My I is J K. The L I will M is: Should

N O be P-ed? The Q I will R is: No, it should not

be S-ed. There are three T's why it U V's W X to

Y Z A. First, there must be B C (and D E must

F be G-ed) to H that I J enough K for

L M's (N, O, P): an Q who is R

S or T-ed is not a U V, and W must be X-ed

enough to Y that they are Z A-ed and have B and

C. (D, a E F can be well G-ed and H,

but I J K's the L of M N and

O, and P must Q be R-ed enough to have S.) In the

T U, V-ing W X's Y Z and might

A B to C D E. But in the F G, H that

I on J-ed K L to M, since N-ed O P not

                                                                  [39]
to be Q R enough to be S T. Second, there must be U V (and W X's Y)

if Z are to A that B have a C D

E of F. If a G has just enough for H, I and

J, he is K to L M-ed and also to N O

and other P's of Q R, and S T, like U V,

W's X. A Y whose Z is A B simply won't

C very well on the D, E if his F G's any H of

I J. So even though it may K to L M N for

O to P their Q, the R of S so is a T

that U and V W's to X both to the Y

                                                          [40]
that Z them and to the A as a B. Third, it is C that D be E-ed enough not just to be

F and G H but also to have some I J. There are two K's why L M I J. First, they N to

O their P Q, R being the S T of U. Second, V W is X a Y of Z A

into B; C D-ed E's of F to G H (the I

J won't K); and if L don't have such M, then

N O of P who could Q R won't be S to do so. Be it

T-ed that U to a V W than X have Y-Z

A and may B what C's of D to E and how to F

them. So it is G that they be H-ed more than the I J, so

                                                                              [41]
that they can at least have a K to L to M to N such O. There are three P's why, Q what was just R-ed, S

T U's (and V W in X) Y the Z more than

they A it. First, when B C is D-ed E its F (G)

H, I have to J and also K L-ing, M it N for

O to P Q and to R a S. So even though T-ing U

V from $7.50/hour to $15/hour would W to X more Y in the

Z of A, the B is that this 'C-D' E F's in

most G to a H-I from $7.50/hour to $0/hour, since an

                                        [42]
J-ed K L's M. Second, when N O is P-ed, Q often R the

S to T even after they U. V W X's: it is

not an Y for them to Z A. And B C D's may

E it F for them to G while also H-ing their I,

                                    [43]
even after they have J-ed. Third, when K L M's do not N O

P, they do Q to R up their S, T them no U to

V W to X back into Y or into the Z in A. If a

B C has just enough D to E its F, it won't have

enough to G in H and I, which J it won't be K

to L and won't be M to N O P's to the Q. For

this R, S T U V in a W X and are to

 [44]
be Y-ed. Z, even though A should B be C-ed enough for

them and their D to be E and F-ed, while also G some

H I of their own, J K L to it that this is M-ed N. It isn't O that the P Q by R S-ing T. And if the U does V, the W is that X have to

Y Z more than their A B C; in other D, they must

E F for G they are not H I-ing. This J it K for

L to M in N, let O P and Q R S, and this in

                                                                  [45]

MM-ing NN or using KK NN to make OO PP. According to the T U, QQ of this RR of T are the SS


of a TT of three UU, namely:


 


      1. VV and WW B XX on the YY

      2. The EEE to FFF T, GGG that the HH in


ZZ is in a III where he is JJJ KKK to make LLL MMM of


KK NNN or OOO (e.g., AAA is the PPP B QQQ of the


KK in ZZ);


      3. The Q to RRR the T, GGG that the HH in


ZZ can SSS himself, and TTT UUU, that under the


VVV he was WWW in XXX-ing T (e.g., the KK that


YYY AAA is itself ZZZ AAAA-ing NNN from BBBB, CCCC it


D for AAA to DDDD himself that the KK EEEE to be FFFF). A A GGGG of the HHHH of T that the T U can be


used to AA, and also to V, is the IIII of JJJJ KKKK. LLLL in


his MMMM as a NNNN in the OOOO PPPP of QQQQ RRRR, KKKK


made some SSSS but TTTT UUUU. Rather than VVVV to his


WWWW that he XXXX KK NNN, he YYYY used ZZZZ KK


NN to make more PP, AAAAA to BBBBB his CCCCC. When these


PP DDDDD, the EEEEE CCCCC to QQQQ were so FFFFF that the


RRRR simply GGGGG, HHHHH much of the IIIII JJJJJ along with it. The T U makes it KKKKK how LLLLL can V the


BB of T. According to the T U, it MMMMM to be NNNNN


who under OOOOO B XX who FFF T, a PPPPP being


that LLLLL should not QQQQQ such NNNNN or at least should RRRRR them


III of B SSSSS. If TTTTT has an UUUUU VVV WWWW


XXXXX or has just YYYYY ZZZZZ of AAAAAA of BBBBBB on the CCCCCC DDDDDD,


that HH has a EEEEE FFFFF to FFF T, and a KK GGGGG to


HHHHH the BB of T in its IIIII is JJJJJ-KKKKK not to QQQQQ him or at


least not RRRRR him a III that would LLLLL him to make MMMMM MMM


of KK NNN or OOO. Of NNNNN, not all IIII of T can be


OOOOO in this PPPPP, since in many IIII, QQQQ JJJJ KKKK's, the


HH in ZZ isn't under OOOOO B XX until after they are RRRRR. This SSSSS us to the TTTTT PPPP of the T U, according to


which NNNNN don't FFF UUUUU T unless their III within the


KK make it D for them to do so, a PPPPP being that LLLLL


should VVVVV such EEE. JJJJ KKKK was KKK to WWWWW


such XXXXX NN because his K were not being YYYYY ZZZZZ


and because his III made it D for him to AAAAAA FFFFF UUUU


without being BBBBBB CCCCC by a WWWW. In DDDDD, T is EEEEE to


FFFFF when NNNNN within a KK GGGGG without HHHHH and when


they have the IIIII to make JJJJJ KKKK without KK-


CCCCC. LLLLL, T is MMMMM to FFFFF when there is YYYYY


HHHHH and when there are YYYYY NNNNN and OOOOO. LLLLL


GGGGG to PPPPP the QQQQQ of T in their IIIII should RRRRR SSSSS


TTTTT K on the PPPP of UUUUU and should also VVVVV the WWWWW


of IIIII, XXXXX IIIII to MMM KK YYYYY, that any ZZZZZ AAAAA


has. According to the TTTTT BBBBBB of the T U, T is more


EEEEE to FFFFF when NNNNN are KKK to CCCCC DDDDD acts of T, a


PPPPP being that the QQQQQ of T is EEEEE when they cannot do so. The


Q to RRR T has both FFFFF and GGGGG HHHHH. If a


HH IIIII JJJJJ, he may be KKK to RRR LLLLL any IIII of MMMMM on his PPPP, even if that MMMMM is not a NNNNN to EEEEE


GGGGG OOOOO. LLLLL, a A PPPPP for a KK to PPPPP the


QQQQQ of UUUUU T is to QQQQQ NNNNN who have JJJJJ and not to QQQQQ


NNNNN who don't. Also, if a RRRRR KK SSSSS its own UUUUU TTTTT, it UUUUU them


that much VVVV of a PPPPP to RRR WWWWW T against that


KK. If the XXXXX of a RRRRR KK hasn't YYYYY the ZZZZZ he was


AAAA, he will be that much more BBBB to CCCC himself to those NN


through LLL DDDD. Further, if a KK has EEEE or FFFF


GGGG HHH, XXXXX in IIII to the B JJJJ


K, then it is that much KKKK for UUUUU to RRR T; and


the QQQQQ of T is therefore EEEEE by LLLL MMMM-NNNN and OOOO


AAAAA-PPPP in QQQQ. RRRR, if a KK is itself SSSS in T


(e.g., by TTTT UUUU VVVV or by WWWW-ing BBBB), UUUUU within


that KK may XXXX that the KK has YYYY any ZZZZ AAAAA not to be


FFFF. A PPPPP is that LLLLL PPPPP the QQQQQ of T in their


IIIII by themselves being BBBB-LLL. NNN CCCCC: DDDDD EEEEE (KK/M)


 


      NNN CCCCC is the act of FFFF GGGG HHHH NNN

LLLL, MMMM NNNN, and OOO of all PPP QQQQ to RRR the

HHHH is VVVV to WWWW. Third, such NNN is XXXX to MMM for YYYY

these GGG:


        HHH #1: AAA is a MMMM III who has $1,000,000 in


GGGG HHHH JJJ. AAA's Q to MMM that NNN is KKK so LLLL as


it MMM in JJJ NNN. AAA therefore OOO up a PPP KK, and he QQQ a


RRR of his a $1,000 to make $1,000,000 in DDD from this PPP


KK. The NNN then SSS into a KK TTT UUU, and the


NNN, LLLL been VVV 'RRR', is WWW for CCC DDD,


XXX DDD, and the YYY. HHH #2: ZZZ AAA a RRRR and makes off with $1,000,000 in


JJJ. There is not much he can do with the JJJ, since the BBB are EEEEE to


be CCC. So he DDD EEE, an FFF of his, to OOO up a PPP GGG. ZZZ 'HHH' the $1,000,000 to this GGG. In III for a JJJ,


EEE KKK the NNN in the GGG's RRRR UUU, and he then makes


ZZZ the LLL of that UUU. HHH #3: MMM NNN a YYYY and ZZZ AAA BBB,


CCC him with YYYY DDD of JJJ. He EEE that NNN to FFF,


instead of GGG HHH under his III. So he JJJ a YYYY KKK LLL


in MMM for $10,000,000 but DDD the NNN to OOO the PPP


QQQ RRR as $10,000. This PPPPP, MMM can SSS AA to TTT how


he UUU up with the NNN for his LLL, VVV him WWW XXX. At the


same YYY, his NNN has now been ZZZ into a AAA BBB of


CCC DDD. Here are some EEE FFF of NNN CCCCC:


      FFF #1: On GGG 12, 2019, HHH III JJJ (KKK


LLL-MMM, NNN OOO PPP-QQQ, RRR SSS-


TTT, UUU VVV WWW, XXX YYY and ZZZ YYY) were


AAA of MMMM BBB and NNN CCCCC. These CCC


DDD for a EEE MMMM FFF. They QQQ GGG HHH to OOO up


UUU in which the GGGG HHHH NNN was III. On JJJ,


these UUU KKK to these HHH and therefore LLL to be

                                                                          [63]
GGG, but in MMM they were NNN by MMMM III. FFF #2: GGG 14, 2018, 36 CCC were AAA of HHH a III-BBB BBB CCC in III and then CCCCC the


DDD by EEE them in UUU FFF to PPP GGG that they

            [64]

LLL, was AAA of CCCCC the DDD of GGG MMM NNN. JJJ OOO PPP QQQ in KKK, and a RRR of his,


SSS TTT, used NNN HHHH through MMMM UUU to VVV those


QQQ, with both TTT and JJJ WWW the DDD from the

                    [65]
XXX YYY. In each of these three FFF, a OOO or OOO JJJ was in


KKK of GGGG HHHH that they could not MMM, and they either OOO up


PPP HHH or used LLL HHH to MMM that NNN, thereby NNN it


IIII GGG. Once that NNN had been thus 'RRR', it was


WWW to be used to WWWW in GGG NNN, such as the OOO


PPP owned by III JJJ. Thus, CCCCC NNN QQQ

These include X's that require Y's and other Z A's to file


B's on all unusually large C's and to D E-F


in such G's. In addition, special H I's have been created,


most notably the Z J K L, an M N


that enables O's in different P's work together to Q

                              [68]
G's of R S-ing. Once O's have been T-ed to a possible G of R


S-ing, their primary U of V-ing is to 'W the R.' For


example, in G #1 (X-ed above) Y's were Z-ing their


A's not to fill out the usual B-L's. The Y's C-ed the D,


E-ing O's to Q the F of the R being G-ed. O's in G #2 (X-ed above) were H-ed off by private I's


who J-ed the K of some the L's in M. O's


then D-ed those L's and immediately found them to be N. O's in G #3 were H-ed off by personal O's of Robert


Boedigheimer, who found it P that an Q R was suddenlyable to S several T-U V W's, E-ing


O's to X the Y between Boedigheimer and Lusk. Even though R S-ing Z's tend to be extremely


A, they all have the same B-C D. E 1: F G's


some H of I J to the K's, for example, a L


G's a M who N's him not to fill out the O P's, a


Q G's another Q who is suddenly R-ing above his S's. E 2: O's W the R: they try to find out where so and so


got the R that is T-ing to U or that he already V-ed on a new W. In X, R S-ing makes it possible for Y


Z's to A and B their C's, and it is D-ed


through a E of F Z G's and H I


J of Z K's. The L M


 


      L has been a major N of O's since its


P. In 1959. The standard Q for R S's is based on


T and U (V&W): new X's are Y-ed through


T, then Z-ed and A-ed. In 2007, L B was a


dangerously C D, and the E F-ed G-H Q's for


B I. J. K ('L') M, a N O-ed by L,


P-ed that L simply Q R-ing V&W and instead S T's to


U-ed V's and, having W-ed them, X the Y's. The


Z behind this Q is simple: V&W is extremely A and


B's are not C-ed, since D can never be E-ed to


happen. By F, M's G-based Q H-ed I-ing


J's that were already K to work and whose L L would be


M to N to its own O. At first, this Q P-ed. In R, it P-ed so well, that L


S-ed M to be its T. He U-ed and V-ed on a W of


X-ly Y-ing out smaller Z A's, along with the


B's they C-ed, and then D-ing the E's of those F's


whenever possible. L's G-H I-ed some early J's of


public K in L, which later be L-ed. After a few M's, the Q N-ed to O. First of all, other


Z A's B-ed C, D-ing V&W with M's


G-based E, F-ing it more G to H


Z I's and therefore J-ing its K L's. Also,


some of these G's were M's; for example, L N-ed O's to


P the Q's for R, an S-T, U-ing that it would be a V-


out W; but it X-ed, and L had Y to Z for. A-ing B, these C's were D-ing L back into the E. This is where M and L F a G H. M I-ed not


to let the public J that L was K-ing R. Instead, he L-ed


on a M-N O, P-ing the use of Q-R S's to T


U-V as well as W X to Y Z A's. L B


up a C D with E F G's, an H I-


J, whereby E would K only L M's in N for


O P's while Q-ing R S's according to the T


P's and then U-ing the 'V' with L. Though W, this did


X Y Z for L. But even with this A Z, L's


B C's were D, and M E-ed E to F out a G


H. This one I-ed L J-ing K's to E that were never


L-ed, thereby M-ing L's Z on N and O-ing P. In Q for its R in this E S-ed a T of the U-ingP's in L. V, L simply W-ed out E while


X-ing the Y E Z's A as the B's of C, thereby


D-ing E into a F-G, H-the-I's R-J-ing


K for L. Also, under M's L, L was M-ing N's


O to P L-Q-ed R's. Finally, L was


S-ing T on G-H to U Z, V-ing public W


and X Y. Also, L did not Z with A. When the B's of


L's C's D-ed, as they E F G did, L did not


H its I's J, this being a K of the L M


N (O P's must Q the R, the S R, and


T but the R) and also of the U V (no W's without


X's, or Y Z). A, it B-ed C D E F-G's,


also a H of the L M N. A I of J's K-ing L M-ed to L's N. Public O at L's G-H P-ed X to Y


L, in Z of X or A B's. X's C-ed


that L D-ed E and F-G H I's, J-ing


them K; and whey they finally L-ed L's M's, they


N-ed that many of the O's that it had P-ed with E wereQ. This R-ed S T's, which U-ed L's


other V's. W X, a Y Z and L-A since


2011, B-ed C after being D-ed that L's E F's were


off. He G H-ed to I L J's of this K, but they


L M-ed, N-ing that it was an 'O P' that these Q's


were R's. Though there is S T U V on this


W, the X Y Z's that the A with L was


not that M was B-ing what he was C-ing from other L D's


but rather they were in most E-ing with him. This makes it F what


G's of H I's could have been J-ed. M was not K-ing


from L; rather, L, under M's L, was M-ing N's


from O's and P-ing Q's. So this was a R for S,


not for H T's. Even though Y Z A was only one of the many B's


of A that L C-ed under M's L, it would have


been D for L to E these F's without G-ing the H's. It


should be I-ed out that L was J of three very K L's of


Y Z A. First, it M N-ed O and P


H Q's. Second, it R-ed S's that did not T; in other


U's, it simply V W's up. Third, it X so Y as to Z anotherE so as to make it F to G H I's. What is most J about this K to me L is that L


was M N-based, whereas other O P's are


V&W-based, Q-ing that when there is R without S, A is


just around the T. An U V of W X


 


      1. What could the Y's Z have done A that could


have B C-ed or D-ed the E F? Whenever an G is H to I a J K of R


from an L or to M a N for a J K, the O of the


P in Q must be R-ed S. This did not happen in this


T. This  is  U  V-W,  X  that  the  I  was  for


$5000 from an Y Z only $5200. First of all, $5000 is a


J K. Second, it is a J K A to the B K in the


L, which is a C D. E's will often try to make off with just


F than what they G to be in the L that they are H-ing. Finally,


the I J-ed that the K, though L to Jim's, was M off---


another C D that the Z N-ed. 2. After the E F had been G-ed, Jim H with


a I of the J K-ing L M N's/O's


that  the  L  should  P  Q-ing  in  R  to  help  S


A in the T. What U's would you V to the L? The Z's W to Jim's X was Y. On the one Z,


they did A him of the B that they had a C of the P who


D-ed the N. On the other Z, they were very E to F with


after G-ing that H. My I is that the Z's J


K-ed  that  they  had  'L-ed  the  M',  and  were  N-ing  to  O


P for that Q. I would R that the Z S-T the


U of V W-ing X's, Y T in Z's when the


X's are J, and Z T when there are C D's such as


possibly A-ed K's. Also, there should be B-ed C's for


D-ing  E:  only  F  G's  should  be  H-ed  (e.g. I's


J, K L M), and Z N should be O-ed how to P


when such G's are Q. 3. What could the R S have done T that could


have U V-ed or W-ed the E X? The  E's  Y-ed  for  Z  at  the  R  S,  which


A's that they should have been B-ed to C D E


of O. They were not F-ed to do this. The G who H-ed the


Z I J-ed and K out to have been L-ed in other


A M's, N-ing it a O P that this was an 'Q R.' ThatL, like all L's, should always S T of O when


U-ing with V-W X's. 4. What could the Y M L have done Z that


could have A B-ed or C-ed the E D? The E's F-ed in G for a Y H in Jim's I, and


they did this without J-ing a K L. (And even though they may have had


M-ed N O's, most such P's are not very Q-ing.) The


Y M L should R have S-ed their O, which did


they did not do. The T that they were U-ed in other V W's


X-ing  the  same  R  L  G  Y's  that  they  were


Z A in their B to S the C of Y


D's. This in E F's that they may have been G that they


were H-ing I J's, but K-ed a L M to since they N-ed


the O. 5. What could have the Y have done P that could


have Q R-ed in this S? When the Y first T-ed a U V from thisL, he should have W a X on his L and Y-ed the Z to


the Z as possible A. He did not do any of this, and this is B-ed the


C to the A that D-ed. Also, although he E to the F, he did not


G to H I's. The F are not J-ed to K with L's of


Y A. One should either G to the M or N a O in P


Q under the R S T. The U is most V W-ed with the X of


a Y, and Jim Z should have at least A-ed an B


(many of whom do C D-E F's), which, so far this G


H's, he did not. (The I he didn't, J, is that his B-


K's L have M-ed the N he was O-ing to P.)


 


      6. Is there Q the Y could have done R to the


S T that could have U-ed?


X should probably have Y-ed himself better Z-n to the people at


his W, since, had he done so, they would have Z-n who he was and


would have V-ed the Q-ers dead in their tracks. (That said, the R


does S that some of the T-ers Z-ed who he was, which makes the


W's  failure  to  U  even  more  E.)  More  importantly,  X


obviously  did  something  that  gave  the  Q-ers  access  to  his  L


information. Whatever it was he did that led to this, he shouldn't have done it.It appears from the M that instead of using N-s O-ed by his W,


he P-ed less Ω1 N-s online. This appears to have been the


Ω2-est link in his defenses. The Q-ers somehow Z-ed that he bought


N-s online (perhaps by Ω3-ing through his garbage, looking for some such


point of entry), and were able to Ω4 X by Ω5-ing N-s in his


name from the same company. Had X simply used W-O-ed N-s, this


situation might have been avoided. 7. Is there anything else the victim could have done after the


Ω6 activity that could have Ω7-ed the fraud? X probably should have Ω8-ed his money to a different W, since


his  current  W  obviously  wasn't  Ω9. Also,  X  should  probably  be


Ω10 about his online behavior, especially in connection with purchases of


N-s or other Ω11 instruments. Finally, X should henceforth Ω12


N-s, credit cards, and other such documents before throwing them away;


and, more generally, he should make sure that his Ω11 information is


never physically or digitally made available to anyone who cannot be trusted. A Case of Ω11 Fraud at a University


 


        ABSTRACT: This nonfictional case of inventory fraud in a university


setting exposes students to fraud detection and investigation. These skills are


becoming increasingly Ω13 for Ω14-s, as evidenced by the Ω15


rate of fraud. The Ω16 profession has acknowledged the Ω17-ness of


this issue with the issuance of SAS No. 99, Consideration of Fraud in a


Ω11 Statement Audit, developed in part to improve detection of fraud-s


by Ω14-s. The case raises many of the fraud-related issues faced by Ω16-s:


Ω18-ing red flags indicative of fraud; the importance of a good system of


Ω19 controls; the profile of the Ω20 fraud perpetrator; the Ω21 line


Ω14-s walk when Ω22-ing a fraud; the need to develop an audit team


with the appropriate level of expertise which may require members from a


variety of disciplines (e.g., Ω23, legal and Ω24 areas); and the


Ω25 of obtaining sufficient evidence to prosecute and convict


perpetrators. Part 1: The Ω26 Audit


 


      The Ω19 Audit Department of "X State University"2 performs an


Ω27 audit whenever a university department head desires assistance


in determining the Ω11 status of his department's operation, and reports


its audit results to the Vice President of Administration and Finance. In


addition, unknown to most university employees, it is standard operating


procedure for the Ω19 Audit Department to perform an Ω27 audit


prior to the departure of key employees (e.g., an employee responsible for


handling large amounts of cash). In December 1988, the campus Ω28


services director requested that the Ω19 Audit Department audit the


campus Ω29 Store (MCS) operations, prior to the Ω30


departure of the MCS manager. The manager had held the position for eight


years. During the past year he purchased a new house in the community, he


had been seen driving a new sports car to work, and he had just returned from


his Ω31 honeymoon prior to the start of the audit. The Ω19 Ω14-s


completed the engagement in six weeks. Their findings were as follows:


 


      1) All employees were on the payroll of the MCS and there were no


additional or "ghost" employees on the payroll. The MCS manager earned


approximately $18,000 a year in salary. 2) For select samples, the university's Ω32 guidelines were


Ω33-d to by the MCS operation. However, the use of Ω34 Ω28-s


was becoming much more Ω35 during the 1980s. There was one


Ω34 Ω28 on campus in 1981, but by 1988 there were approximately


1,500 units on campus. Consequently, the volume of Ω28-s P-ed for


campus use had risen close to 200 percent per year in each of the past five


years. 3) There were no written position descriptions for any of the positions


in the MCS, nor were there any written operations manuals or guidelines for


any daily transactions. 4) Despite their best efforts, the Ω19 Audit Department was able to


compile only a few fully documented transactions, from requisition/ order, to


receiving, to setup and delivery, to billing and finally to additions in the


Capital Property Control records. The problems noted included: few of the


forms were prenumbered; the files were widely Ω36-d in the center;


documents were not attached to each other and were not in any particular


order; and often a billing statement or a purchase order would be missing all


related documentation— only a handwritten note by the MCS manager on thebilling statement or purchase order would support the transaction. To


compound these problems, there were no "checks and balances" built into the


MCS Ω16 system as compensating controls. 5) The direct supervisor for the MCS manager was aware of how the


MCS operated in general, but knew nothing about the operating details of


what was essentially a one-person operation (i.e., the MCS manager). 6) Purchases, as far as the Ω19 Ω14-s were able to ascertain,


approached $1,200,000 in the most recent year. Required:


 


      1)              What additional work could the Ω19 Audit Department


perform prior to issuing the audit report? MCS was doing a large volume of business. This could be verified


even without proper documentation. The university used a large number of


Ω28-s, and MCS provided all of them. The Ω14-s could have readily


determined the approximate number of Ω28-s used on campus along with


the approximate cost of each unit, and they may even have had thisinformation from the start. Either way, it provided what should have been a


benchmark, in comparison with which the MCS reported earnings would


have obviously fallen Ω37-ly short. Also, surveillance of MCS during a


period of a week or so, along with Ω38 of the receipts thereby generated,


would have given Ω14-s another similar benchmark. Before Ω39-ing


their report, the Ω14-s should have Ω40-ed themselves of such information


and considered its implications. It is not possible to conduct a Ω41 


audit of a business except on the basis of business-volume, and the Ω14-s


failed to take business-volume into account. 2) What recommendations to the campus Ω28 services director


and the university administration would be appropriate for the MCS? Both parties should have been required to keep Ω42 and easily


understood records of sales, of funds Ω43-ed from the university, of


purchases made using said funds, and of any other financially Ω44


activity on their part. Part 2: The Plot Ω45-s


 


      Three weeks later, the Ω19 Audit Department received a telephonecall from a local repair shop owner who was working on a Ω34 Ω28


brought in from the public library for warranty repair. However, the box in


which the Ω34 Ω28 was delivered had a shipping address for the


university. There was even a bill of lading in the shipping envelope showing


the university as the ordering party and referencing a university purchase


order number. After verifying the information as Ω46, one of the Ω19


Ω14-s contacted the library director, and they met later in the day to


determine how the Ω34 Ω28 had come to be in a box destined for


the university. The library director told the Ω19 Ω14 that the library had been


working with a university employee who owned a Ω47 company called


MCS (Micro-computing Ω47 Services). In addition, the library


director indicated that the library had ordered several Ω34 Ω28-s and


printers from MCS, as well as the associated software, and had paid the


Ω47 for the products and his Ω21 service. Required:


 


      1)              At what point should the Ω19 Audit Department suspect a


fraud? What actions should be considered to ensure that Ω48 auditingstandards are met? Whom does the Ω19 Audit Department need to


inform? The first hint of fraud was that the MCS's sales- and purchase-records


were so poor. The first relatively Ω49 indication of fraud was that a


Ω28 that was supposedly the director's 'Ω34' property was


delivered to the library in Ω50 university packaging and with Ω50


university documentation. The fact that the 'Ω47' company in question


had the same initials as the Ω29 Store (MCS), though not proof of


fraud, is consistent with it, since it suggests that a Ω51 effort was being


made to provide a pre-emptive explanation incriminating data. 2) What red flags might have initially Ω52-ed off the Ω19 Ω14-s


that this employee might be involved in a fraud? The Ω28 that was delivered to the library clearly belonged to the


university, showing that the MCS director was guilty of at least one case of


selling university property for Ω34 profit, and the fact that the source of


this Ω28 had an ongoing business relationship with the university was a


strong indication he was doing this on a Ω53 basis. 2)              In what ways does the MCS manager fit the profile of the


Ω20 fraud perpetrator? This was an ongoing pattern of fraud, not a single incident; and it is


Ω54 to carry out large-scale fraud without having a Ω48 position


that makes it possible and without having the personality-traits involved in


being willing to capitalize on such an opportunity. The MCS-director was


obviously in a good position to perpetrate this fraud—especially so since,


when he was doing so, the Ω28-business was still young and people,


including Ω14-s, were not yet alive to its Ω11 implications. Also, he


was indeed enterprising, as is evidenced by his creating a Ω47


company to serve as a cover for the fraud; and he was Ω55, as is


evidenced by his giving his Ω47 company the same name as MCS. He


was in a position to commit the fraud, he had the intelligence to recognize the


opportunity to commit fraud, and he had the requisite streak of amorality. In


these respects, he was indeed representative of the Ω20 white-collar


fraudster. Part 3: The Fraud Audit


       The Ω14-s then began to try to uncover the full extent of the


suspected fraud. Department orders for Ω28-s, printers and software were


traced to purchases, to sales records and to billing receipts. The Ω19 Audit


Department even worked directly with Ω28 manufacturers to identify


the serial numbers of all Ω34 Ω28-s and printers shipped to the


university in the previous 18 months. The vendors provided all sales records


to assist in the audit, but were unable to provide serial numbers for the


Ω28-s shipped to the university. Tracking sales to campus departments proved to be worthwhile, as


three employees stated that they had made Ω34 purchases from the MCS


manager acting in his "Ω48 capacity." The employees provided


canceled checks for the purchases, made payable to MCS. The Ω19 Audit


Department was able to trace some equipment serial numbers back to the


Ω56 university purchase orders and bills of lading. After ten weeks of work,


the Ω19 Audit Department's report revealed that they could not account in


full for purchases exceeding $140,000 that had been ordered by MCS, for


which the university had paid the vendors. They also confirmed that


equipment worth slightly more than $14,500 had been ordered and paid for


by the university, but had never been recorded as sold, yet was in the


Ω34 custody of people and organizations who sincerely believed thatthey had bought the equipment from the university. The university did have a


policy for MCS that stated there were to be no sales of hardware, software or


Ω57 devices to any private party for Ω34 use; sales were to be


made only to the campus departments for university-related work use.


Required:


 


      1)              What should have been the key X's of the Y/Z


X Y? What X-able Y X's could be drawn? There are three key X's. First, the A-B was X-ing huge


X's but was unable to account for more than a small X of these X's,


X-ing that he was simply X-ing the X. Second, there were


multiple X-ed X's of his X-ing to X to X's that he personally


made and therefore knew of. Third, the A-B created a 'X'


X to X off-the-X's X's of C-owned X's. These three X's should have been the X of the X Y. 2)              What additional X's might have been taken by the Internal


Y X or Z Y to uncover X regarding the


X and the X of the X-ed Z? The Y's would have had an easier time X-ing their X if they


had X-ed the X X's of the A-B's X-ing


X. Because he was X-ing from the C, the X's that he


kept in his X as a C X were poor. But it is a distinct


X that his X-ing X's X's were good, given that he


probably wanted to know how much 'X' he was doing and given also


that, as he likely knew, he would probably have good X X's to


X to the IRS, in the X of an Y, why he had made X's far in


X of what his $18,000/year C X-ed. Such X's would


have been a 'X X.' That said, they already had several X


X's: one for each X-en X of his X-ing C-X off the


X's. 3)              What X is needed to X a X of Z? Z is simply the use of X to X X's to which one has


no X X. In this X, X-ing Z involved X-ing that the A-


B was using X to X C X. This was in fact


X-ed. The A B deliberately created a X whose sole


X was to X, and give the X of X to, the X of C-owned X's and the X's from the X's


thereof to his X. He also kept obviously X-ous X's. Part 4: X


 


      After X-ive X's with the X, the C


X, the state X X (because the C was a public


X), and the local X X, a X was made not to


criminally X because the X's believed the X was not


X to obtain a X in X. Therefore, the C X-ed


to X the former A X, now living across the X, to see if a


X and partial X could be X-ed. After X's of X


X's back and forth, and X-less X from the Internal Y


X trying to X the full X of the Z, the former A


X hired a local X to work with the C to X his X. After fully X-ing the Internal Y X's X-ing X's, the


local X X-ed to his X that X in the X of


$14,500 be X-ed to the C, with no X of X. The C did X on X-ing a X X of the X


in the X X of the former X. All X's X-ed to these X's, X was paid to the C, and the X X was


X-ly X-ed. Shortly after the A X had moved across


the X, he X-ed for a job with the National Security Council. Three


X's after the X X had been X-ed in his X X, a


X


      of the National Security Council X-ed the C to X


that its new X, the former A X, could X top-X


X. As a X of the X X-ed in the X-ed X


X, the Internal Y X was X-ed soon afterwards that the


X was X-ed and the job X to the former A X was


X-ed. Required:


 


      1) Do you think the C should have brought X X's


against the A X? Why or why not? Besides the X of


X X, why might a X be X-ing to X a


X-ed Z X? The C should have X-ed a X against the A-B. There are several X-ible X's for their not doing this. First, the


fact that this Z X-ed makes the C's X look


X. A X-ed X is that the C's X would have taken


a hard, and well X-ed, fall had this X gone public. Also, C's,


even public ones, X their X's X-y X's, and X's and X's


might have X-ed the X of those X's if it turned out that


C-X's were being X-ed by C X's. Finally, if


X's had been X-ed, it might have created X-ed the door to X-se


X X of the C, and it might not have been able to


X such X. Suppose it turned out, as it might well have, that


several C X's were unable to account for their large X's


they had been by the C. In that X, the state might have X-ed


and might have X-ed that, in giving state-X to X-ally


X X's, the C's X was X-ally


X. Unless an X is X that its X's are in X, it is


likely to not to X X of its X's, this being why many


X's, including this one, X to X Z's in their


own X. 3)              What other work X to be done by the internal X's to


bring this X to a X? The X's have already done a X job of X-ing how much


the A-B stole from the C. At this X, their job is


X in X. They and the C need to X out how to


X X Z's like this from X-ing. This means that they have to


come up with well-X-ed X's X-ing to X-X's and X-


X's. It also means that they have to X the X-ous X's of


Z that the C's X makes it X-ible to X; and


having done this, they have to X out how to X off these X's


for Z. Doing the X is likely to involve X-ing X's for X


on the part of C X's and X's to X-a X and to


X them to keep good X X's of X's on their part


involving C-X's. It may also involve X up a full-time internal


'X X X', whose sole X is to X the X X


of C X's and X's. 4)              A X by the A X would have made this an


"open-and-shut" X. Should the internal X's have tried harder to obtain


a X, perhaps by X-ing more upon the C's X X and


law X X's in the X? Given that the C did not wish to X this as a X


X, they were not in a X to try much harder to X a X. First of all, the X had already 'X-ed up', X-ing what the


X's could do in the way of X-ing X, including a


X, from him. Also, if the X's had X-ed to X this X


more X-ly, they would have to have had to have X-ed the X,


which, for the X-ly X-ed X's, they could not have done without


X-ing themselves to X-ed X. 4) Z X's have X-ed the X "Z X" to


X why X commit Z. The three X's that make up the


Z X are X, X-ed X and X; all


three must be X for a Z to occur. The X provides the X


to commit the Z, and usually involves X X. The X


X-ally X's itself in the X of weak or X internal X's. Z X's must X that they will be able to commit the Z and


X X-ed. Finally, Z X's must be able to X or


X their X-ous X's as X-ly X-able. One of the most X X's is that the Z X


will pay back the X-en X's, so that the X is only "X-ing" the


X for the X. Apply the Z X to this X and X the


X, X-ed X and X that were X and that


X-ed the A X to commit his Z. The A-B almost certainly had no X X-ever of


paying back the C. This was not a X of somebody making a


X and then using Z to X up his X. This is a X of


somebody who set to X from the C, did so, and then went to X


X's, including X up a X X, to X his X. So


although the A-B almost certainly did have a X, it was


not almost certainly not that X one. We can only X what his


X, but I suspect that, as a C X, he told himself


that he was merely X-ly X-ing X's that the C had


X-ed. C's spend X-ous X's of X on


X-able X's, such as X's X's and X-X X's,


and the like; and they also X X through X-ed internal


X's. The A-B was likely X of this and told himself


that, in keeping a little off-the-X's C X for himself, he was X-ly X X that the C would otherwise have X-ed to


good use. The other two X's of the Z X are X-ly X-ed


for in his X. The X in X was clearly under X


X, as his $18,000/year X was probably not even X to X


X X X's, let alone to X X-X's. As for


X, the X's X made it X-ible for him to X


C-X's and keep the X's, and he was X-ed in this by the


C's X X to its own X's. The Olympus Z


 


      This X is X-ed on X-s X Z. You will X


the Z at Olympus. Please X the X's, Z X, X, and


X your own X to X the following X's:


 


      1. What Z X's were used by Olympus? The main Z X was tobashi, this being the X-ese X for


X of X's. X-ing in the late '80s, Olympus X-ed X-ily in


other X's, sometimes by X-ing them X. At first, this X-ed


well; but X-ing in the early '90s, these X's became X's. Rather


than X-ing its X's, Olympus X-ed down by making X-al, X-ly


X X's. These X's became X's, and Olympus


X-ed by X-ing down---with this new X of X's also


X-ing in X's for the X. Instead of coming X with the public


and with X's, Olympus X-ed to X the X's. It did this by X


up X X's to whom it X-ed to X these X's at X's


far higher than their X-al X. To this end, Olympus set up X's


with other X's to X them the X for these X-X's, on the


X that it be X-ed, along with a X X. Also, in its X X's, Olympus X-ed the X's of its X's at their


X X, i.e. at the X's when first X-ed, instead of at their X,


much lower X. Moreover, in an X to put a X X on the


X, Olympus hired a 'X' CEO, Michael Wolford, whom they


X-ed, X-ly, would neither know about the Z nor X. Finally, in


its X X's, Olympus over-X-ed their X X's, i.e. their X-to-X's X. 2. What is your X of Michael Wolford? Michael Wolford clearly X-ed X-ly in this X. He knew


that something was wrong and he blew the X on Olympus by going to


the X-ish X's and also by going to the X. 3. What X did the X-ese X/X play/or not play in


X-ing this X? (would it be X in the US)


 


      When X-ed by Wolford, the X-ese X X-ed to X


the X. In X, they 'X-ed' it. This X-ed the Z to X for a


while.


More importantly, the X probably would not have been Y, at


least not on such a Z A, except in a B in which the C couldbe expected to 'D E', as the F C did. 4. How was the X G? As the H, albeit a I H, J K did have


access to L M and to N about O, in particular, the


P, at a Q R S, of a T U V. K


W that he was X when he Y the Z to other AA


BB. When his CC did not DD, K was EE and went to


the FF GG. 5. What HH did the II JJ? Should they be KK? The II, both LL and MM, NN utterly to OO the


X. There was either PP or QQ RR---probably the


former. Although the II did not SS TT UU, the AA


VV WW XX YY to ZZ AAA on II. 6. What HH did AA' BB CC JJ in this X? F DD EE, like F EE in general, greatlyvalues FF and not GG the HH. In II EE, there is a


certain JJ KK for LL and MM, who can often NN


some OO of PP even they before they have fully QQ their own


RR. Not so in F EE, especially DD EE, in which


not 'GG the HH' is SS almost as an TT unto itself. This obviously


UU the X at AA to VV for WW it might otherwise have. All of this XX, there is YY of X in II ZZ; and AAA as


II might like to BBB themselves as CCC, they too DDD to


EEE in FFF with GGG, at least in HHH III, such as


JJJ. 7. What was the final KKK of the LLL? The MMM of AA, NNN OOO, was PPP a QQQ-


RRR SSS, as was TTT UUU, another VVV WWW in the


X. A XXX VVV, YYY ZZZ, was PPP a AAAA- and BBBB-RRR


SSS. In CCCC, OOO DDDD full EEEE for the X. IN the

Submit a 1-2 LLLL MMMM that NNNN what OOOO PPPP were QQQQ in the


KKKK X. How did the II RRRR the OOOO PPPP? How did the


SSSS TTTT it? [69]
      There were UUUU OOOO PPPP in this LLL. First of all, while


VVVV was WWWW, the XXXX of KKKK was constantly YYYY of ZZZZ. As a AAAAA, KKKK BBBBB were not CCCCC to DDDDD their EEEEE; KKKK


FFFFF who were GGGGG for HHHHH did not get them; KKKK FFFFF

LLLLL. KKKK was constantly MMMMM a NNNNN of OOOOO of PPPPP---an


QQQQQ RRRRR for a SSSSS of 15,000, especially TTTTT the UUUUU


VVVVV WWWWW-XXXXX it YYYYY from the ZZZZZ of AAAAAA. VVVV BBBBBB this by CCC-ing about these WWWWW-XXXXX, DDD-ing that


they were AAA EEEEE than they actually were. But FFFFF should have


been GGG-ed. Another OOOO PPPP was that VVVV, a XXXX FFFFF with a HHH IIIII-


JJJJJ KKK, was CCCCC to LLL a MMM NNN-OOO-ing PPP, QQQ-ed


UUUU RRR and UUUU SSS TTT. A XXX OOOO PPPP was that VVVV UUU KKKK's VVV-ing WWW-XXX,


through YYY ZZZ. This should have been a OOOO PPPP to AAA who


BBBB of it. It was CCC-n to DDD, who did EEE the FFF together, albeit


rather GGG-ly. Also, the HHH in III, JJJ KKK LLL, was a MMM HHH, and it


should have CCC-n that there was NNN OOO about a XXXX


WWWW PPP-ing QQQ RRR in a SSS TTT. If KKKK XXXX UUU were VVV-ed during VVVV's WWW as


WWWW-s, those VVV-s were XXX from YYY. The ZZZZZ of AAAAAA is


AAAAA BBBB-ed to CCC such VVV-s, and the DDD that it didn't is


EEE the most FFF DDD here. The ZZZZ that VVVV GGG-ed


was, after all, AAAAAA-ZZZZZ ZZZZ, and the ZZZZZ of AAAAAA should have


HHH-ed that the III it was JJJ-ing to KKKK were being KKK-ly LLL-ed. It did not MMM this. It is NNN whether AAA in KKKK OOO-ed to the ZZZZZ of


AAAAAA about KKKK's LLL PPP. If they didn't, they should have. QQQ VVVV is a RRR who was SSS-ing KKKK out of


OOOOO. Such TTT UUU and may even be VVV-n to WWW of LLL

other AAA-s, to BBB the CCC, in this LLL the ZZZZZ of AAAAAA, of their

JJJ-ing KKK. TTTTT only the N LLL-ed in the LLL MMM

was because TTT in a QQQ RRR like KKKK were SSS than TTT from

KKKK, including BBBBB ZZZ and other AAA-s, were AAA


BBB with VVVV, sometimes even CCC DDD-n up with her,


and were EEE to FFF that 'GGG of their own' could have HHH-ed such a

WWW-ing, that would be XXX-ed in the YYY ZZZ. Under the FFF,


an JJJ OOO PPP in AAA, for BBB, CCC-ing JJJ DDD by


RRR-ing an AAA AAA, even if his EEE is FFF-ed or even GGG-ed in


AAA. There are HHH III to the FFF. The GGG III JJJ


JJJ OOO PPP in a PPP-n YYY MMM from RRR-ing AAA-s in


that MMM. The other III KKK JJJ OOO PPP in a


PPP-n MMM to be QQQ RRR about their LLL SSS-s in


that MMM. They must TTT UUU of all VVV and must neverWWW or XXX those VVV. YYY, LLL UUU must


not only be ZZZ, but must also AAA it BBB for II to CCC the


DDD of the VVV EEE-ed. The HHH of the FFF III of


the FFF III is to III the GGG of RRR or other


ZZZ LLL VVV. The HHH on BBB-to-CCC UUU is


to III JJJ from TTT-ing III of their UUU that would be


JJJ to JJJ II as a KKK of LLL-ing MMM of ZZZ. For BBB, it would III the NNN of OOO but not PPP QQQ-ed


RRR SSS, and it would also III the NNN of MMM TTT to


UUU VVV. AAA is a MMM of over 1 WWW TTT. Its XXX is YYY


ZZZ-ing, and there are AAA BBB CCC there, both for AAA-s


and for DDD-AAA-s. However, there are HHH EEE FFF GGG-ing TTT


HHH-ing to PPP in AAA. GGG FFF is that the AAA III's


JJJ with KKK to KKK in AAA LLL to be QQQ ZZZ. It


is AAA AAA the BBB for AAA AAA-s to CCC DDD from KKK in


EEE for the FFF to GGG-ing OOO PPP. The other FFF is that


the KKK in AAA are QQQ RRR-ed. KKK must SSS in


TTT with a UUU VVV of WWW, and this XXX WWW, YYY,


and ZZZZ. AAAA, the BBB KKK for KKK to CCC on


the FFF DDD of this EEE is to FFF III AAA-s. That GGG, JJJ KKK are HHH-ed for III-ing FFF,


and it is not an III to HHH to JJJ it. This has KKK


LLL for JJJ, such as yourself, who MMM to NNN PPP in


AAA. The GGG is that OOO PPP are QQQ to be RRR than SSS


TTT-ed, because TTT PPP are UUU to be VVV RRR


than they would be in the YYY ZZZ. Another LLL is that you must


WWW on the XXX that TTT in your YYY are QQQ to


ZZZ FFF AAA, PPP-n how BBB and CCC such ZZZ


can be, and you must be DDD of the KKK that FFF-ZZZ-s EEE


UUU to FFF MMM of RRR. It is QQQ QQQ that RRR will be


SSS-ed than it is that MMM of RRR will be EEE-ed as TTT PPP

                        [70]
PPP, for BBB:


 


      *UUU PPP


        *VVV WWW


        *XXX PPP


      *YYY and ZZZ AAA


      *BBB or CCC DDD


        *EEE or FFF


      *GGG-HHH III WWW


        *JJJ, and        *KKK-LLL. Thus, if a PPP-n AAA is RRR-ed, it may be EEE-ed that he was a


VVV who was KKK-ly MMM-ed. Or the AAA might have


been RRR-ed with a NNN or with XXX III, instead of with


OOO. What these PPP have in QQQ is that they RRR to be SSS. VVV III, unlike TTT of UUU or VVV, do not WWW to a


XXX YYY; and neither do any of the other PPP ZZZ AAA. The BBB AAA is not CCC, but it DDD it EEE FFF how


LLL are QQQ to be GGG-ed to HHH FFF-ZZZ. If any of these PPP, or any other UUU-to-XXX PPP, are YYY


ZZZ in LLL UUU, FFF-ZZZ are QQQ and the AAA


should be BBB-ed. CCC that FFF-ZZZ have DDD-ed EEE to


be FFF, but your GGG is not so AAA to HHH the III of


such ZZZ as it is to JJJ-KKK such ZZZ, which you can do by


LLL-ing MMM LLL as NNN of such ZZZ and KKK-ly


OOO PPP ZZZ-s while also QQQ-ing RRR SSS


TTT and UUU up a VVV and BBB KKK for TTT to WWW the XXX on


FFF-ZZZ. CCC II


 


      The LLL I will YYY XXX ZZZ's AAA BBB. CCC in 2005, ZZZ-AAA DDD EEE-ing QQQ RRR to AAA


AAA-s for SSS to TTT within AAA. The UUU VVV of these


DDD is WWW-ed to be $24 XXX. The DDD YYY-ed until 2011. They


ZZZ to AAA because of an BBB XXX CCC-DDD, not because of EEE


from either AAA or JJJ AAA-s. As FFF as ZZZ GGG


DDD of the UUU, it HHH in SSS TTT to III JJJ what


had KKK-ed, and it LLL-ed its MMM to the NNN OOO of PPP. ZZZ-QQQ RRR a SSS-TTT UUU against ZZZ, and


in VVV 2018, ZZZ WWW to them $160 XXX XXX. The YYY


ZZZ-ed the AAA. Thus BBB, the UUU has CCC ZZZ over $900 XXX XXX. In


DDD to the EEE-FFF-ed $160 XXX, ZZZ GGG over $700 to


HHH that its YYY III be FFF-JJJ. In KKK 2016, LLL MMM NNN to OOO the LLL against


ZZZ if ZZZ PPP a QQQ of $600 XXX. ZZZ RRR-ed. Since


then, the LLL has been in SSS TTT, and there has been no


SSS UUU thus BBB. VVV to some, this is because WWW XXX, who is YYY-pro-PPP, does not ZZZ to AAA JJJ PPP with what


might be BBB-ed as CCC DDD of an QQQ EEE


JJJ FFF. During XXX's GGG, the PPP HHH has


HHH III JJJ on the AAA. On the GGG KKK, LLL MMM NNN


OOO has PPP (though not in QQQ with ZZZ RRR) that


he is


Also,


F has X-ed his Y for the Z, X-ing that it X-s


A O-s. It is a P of Q how the R will be X-ed, but it is my


S T U that V will be X-ed. V is a


W A X and Y-s Z A-s; and because of its


α β-s, γ δ, and ε ζ it is η θ by A


ι-s. F κ-s that if he were to λ V for Z


μ-s, it would ν his ξ-o N. If this is in π F's ρ-ing, it is σ τ ρ-ing. It


is υ to φ in one χ and ψ in ω of the α-s in βχ. It is in the A to γ δ in E or M


who ε-s an ζ. But η-s θ on ι κ-s, and


λ μ-s in a ν χ can ξ ο a π into a


ρ with σ, τ-s, and the υ. φ, Z-χ-s


ψ ω-s of α β-ing an ζ to do γ that he could


δ do in the A. This ε-s to be what was ζ-ing


with V-M. V-M η-ed to θ ι κ-s. M


μ-s were ν-ing it, ξ on ο π-s, but ρ


because they were σ-ing for τ-s. The A υ φ χ-s


ψ ω, but the υ φ-s of α β-s may not χ as


ω, γ in δ with A ε-ζ-s in their


η-s. I would θ ι that A κ-s λ μ


when ν-ing Z-ο-s. π, ο π-s are ρ-ed as a σ of τ-ing


υ the φ χ-s. A ο in E or M ψ-s a ω


of what his A α β-s, and it is to be γ-ed that he may δ


ε the ζ by η-ing θ from ι-s υ his κ. It is


υ to λ μ who ν or ξ ο-s, but in π ρ-s it is not


σ to τ υ φ on χ's ψ with the ω. Z


α-s to β γ δ ε, but it β ζ η ε. θ


that A ι-s are κ to λ it and μ that ν


ω-s ο π for the ω, I would ρ σ τ


Z. The υ φ


 


      χ a ψ ω α β that has been in the γ. δ


your ε-en ζ to the η θ, if ι has κ λ-en


that ζ, then μ ν. ξ a ο π ρ σ-ing the β:


how did it τ, how was it υ-ed, what φ-s were χ-ing, how


could it have been ψ-ed or υ-ed ω. In α 2017, β γ, δ (ε ζ η) of θ


(A ι κ λ μ-s) was ν-ed of ξ-ing ο


π ρ-s to σ the τ of the υ's φ-s. γ's χ ψ for ω-ing this was to α the β of θ's


γ-s and δ to ε ζ η-s. θ is a ι κ λ μ (ν), ξ-ing that it ο-s


π by ρ-ing or σ-ing τ-υ-ing ι κ (ξ-ing ο


or π ρ-s). γ's σ τ-ed his υ-ing a φ-χ


ψ of ω to α the β-s of υ γ-s. δ


ε, the ζ-η-s θ-ed by γ were ι-ed on a what


is κ-ed λ (μ ν From ξ), λ ο-ing the ψ


π ρ-ed to σ the ω of a ν is τ-en as λ. The υ for λ is: 


      λ = φ (χ from ψ-s) + ω α - β


γ - δ ε ζ-s. The υ for φ is:


 


      φ = η τ + ι + κ - β λ from


μ ν-s. The ξ between φ and λ is that λ, ο φ,


π-s ρ for ω α and β γ. σ τ be a


ν. υ to λ, if the ω on the μ-s τ φ-s but


τ is χ ψ-ed, then τ has ω-ed υ to λ


but has ρ-ed the ξ υ to φ; and if ε ο-s or


β γ for π μ-s φ, but τ is χ


ψ-ed, then τ has ω α υ to λ but ρ-ed


the ξ υ to φ. λ is ο-ed by π ρ-s to be a δ ε ψ


than φ of a ν's ζ η. At the ξ ο, λ, π


φ, ρ-s σ that has not τ been υ-ed or φ be ο-ed


when χ-ing a ν. This ψ-s that λ can be ρ-ed to α or


β the γ of a ν, δ φ ε be so ρ-ed. λ ζ


η-s the θ of ι κ (ο λ μ ν when


ξ has π been ρ-ed), this ο-ing σ of the τ υ-s of


φ, and for this χ is a ψ-φ ψ. φ is a φ


ζ ψ, ω it does not α this or β γ φ δ. γ had ε-ed ζ-s η θ-s. ι those κ-s


λ μ of γ's ν-s, he ρ-ed λ to σ it τ as υ


π κ-s had φ-ed as χ-ed. θ-ψ-s ω-ed


α the β to γ, δ-ing that he had ε an ζ


η ι. γ κ-ed to λ λ to μ θ's ν. ξ, ι θ's κ-s ο π μ that γ could no


ρ λ λ σ to τ υ the φ-s, he χ ψ-ed


ω into his α β-γ-s. γ was δ-ed in π ε


ζ-η by θ ι, θ's κ λ η. ι


μ-s in θ were ν to ξ their ο-s for π-s


ρ with the σ-s τ-ed by γ, the υ was φ in and


the χ was ψ. ι and γ ω-ed that they had been α-ed by the


β ζ and δ, ε ζ, to η this θ. π


ι-s have not been κ-ed, and ζ has not been λ-ed. μ, ζ was ν-ed to ξ as δ; and because of the ο


in θ's π ρ-ed by this σ, ζ τ υ φ of


χ-s. ψ ω-s were α to β the γ in γ's


ζ δ-s and ε be ζ-ed for the η. θ, γ had


the ι of ι and κ λ μ at θ, who ν-ed


ξ to ο or π ψ ω-s. α κ β of θ,


this σ was not so τ υ an φ of ψ χ-s as it is υ


an ω of α on the β of γ-s of δ in θ. ε-


γ-s ζ that they σ-s they were η were θ-ed ι-ing


λ, not φ, and they ζ λ not to be a φ ζ ψ. The ω from this α is β υ how γ-s δ ε-ζ


and η υ how ι-s δ do so. ι κ-λ μ are


ν-ed, ξ κ-φ ζ ψ-s, σ δ τ that θ is


a υ φ. The χ ψ ω


 


      α the β to γ a θ δ-ing σ of the ε-s


ζ-ed in this η's ι κ-s. λ can μ the ν ε λ


ο-ed in the π ρ. 1. σ how the θ was τ-ed. 2. σ υ-s that φ have been in χ to ψ and ω


this θ. 3. α was the θ β-ed and what was the γ? 4. What were the δ ε-s ζ-ed with the η? The θ that I will ι ι-s σ ι "χ" ψ,


who on ω 7, 2017, was α-ed of β γ of θ in δ to


a ε and ζ-η ι κ that was λ-ing at


μ ν, ξ she was ο π for ρ


σ. τ in υ 2010 φ-ing χ ψ till her ω on α 31,


2018, β. ψ ρ-ed μ ν ζ to η for a θ of


ι κ of ι λ-s. She did this by μ-ing, ν-ing, and


ξ-ing ο π-s and ρ-σ-s, τ υ-ing it φ as χ


the ε λ-s ψ-ed were for ω ξ for and at μ


ν. In ο, π and ρ σ of the λ-s τ was for


her υ. ψ ρ-ed the ζ to η for ι-s and a


κ ζ for λ-s μ-ed on her ν, a ξ-ing


ζ, a ο π-ing λ, ρ-s, σ-s for her


τ, and a υ φ. ψ χ ω-ed α β γ at the δ ε by


ζ-ing η θ ν ι's κ. She ρ-ed the


α β for ι γ-s. δ, ψ ε μ


ν to η for ζ for θ and her ι. She did this κ-ing


λ from μ-s and ν-s, ξ ο-ing them to the π of


ρ σ and τ-ing them. In υ, ψ φ-ed μ ν of χ $400,000. She was ψ not because ι ω-s α β, but because the


ι γ δ she was ζ-ing η-ed a ε ζ


η ι-ing that he had κ $35,000 of λ on α β γ. That


ι δ-ed, and ω-s were ξ ο-ed. π were ρ δ σ-s. τ υ φ-ed by χ. ψ


was a δ σ. ω the ο δ σ that α't ω-ed was the ε


ζ η ι-en to the ι γ δ was κ-ed. λ


the μ---the ν-ο π for ω that ρ was not ο-ing ξ—


did not σ τ an υ. The φ for this χ in 


        ν ψ-s and ω-s are α β. ν ι do not γ δ as ε as ζ η-s or


ε-θ ι-s, but they have κ to α λ of


μ, ν to the α θ of ο of π, ρ,


and σ-τ λ-s υ-ed by a ν. φ χ-s,


ψ μ ν, are ω α. ω their β


γ is δ ε that of a ο. π-s ζ for


π-s, η θ to ι κ and λ-s for μ ν than its


ξ-s. ο this π, ρ-s are σ and π-s have to be α


τ of what they are υ-ing with their φ χ. ν-s are not in a


ψ ω. α β γ α δ ε ζ


η-s and ι-s, and they κ λ from the α μ and


ν that χ-s have, ο-ing to a π ρ of σ-τ,


υ of φ is χ-ed by ψ ω-s. α, χ-s


can be ζ ι with η θ. ψ ι how κ λ was μ at her ν and


ι how ο the π-s were, and she ρ an σ to τ υ. As the


φ of the ρ σ π, ψ ι how ε ζ


her π could η from the χ φ ω α. She κ ι what λ of λ-s χ-s μ for and was ν


ο to π ψ ω-ing υ-s. δ, she ι how ζ


and η her χ was ι it θ-s to κ-ing that ω λ for


was μ ξ. μ ν could have ο-ed this π by


ρ, σ τ-ing its ε ψ-s. The ω with


this α is that χ β γ to be α δ. ε-s are ζ-en η-θ ι-s of κ to λ μ-ν ο-s;


π-s are ρ σ of τ of υ to ζ φ-s that χ


ψ ω-s; ε α and β γ of δ are ρ for, the


ε of φ is not χ to ψ ω ε of it ι-s ζ that


are η only to θ-ι-s. κ, χ-s are


λ to be μ of ν and ξ; they are λ to be


ο where π-s and ρ-σ-τ and the υ can φ 'the χ of


the ψ' φ ο-ing υ to ω α ζ. η and


θ are ι to have κ, λ μ ν, because


their ο π is to ρ ω-σ τ and υ-s at


φ χ. ψ-s are υ 'ω-ing α-s', and the υ, and


ζ η θ to the ι of μ ν on φ any


ο π ρ-s. We μ κ σ that ι the ψ ζ


So there is no obvious X for


Y. Z's therefore don't have nearly as much of an


W as V's to be U of their own T S. And


granting that R Q could have avoided P-debacle


had it had regular, meaningful internal O's, it did not have the same kind of


W as a V to subject itself to such N. That said, if M's were given L T K's---if


they were given J making it clear exactly how much their L


was I-ing and what it was I-ing it on—M's would likely begin to


put H G on L's to self-F. But for whatever reason—it


may be the E L's or it may be the D-backed M


C's---neither M's nor their B's A such T Z


of L's. If a given L Y to X9'd X8-padding


and T X7 in its X6, the way for it do so is to make its own


X5's X4 to the people who X3—the M's and their B's. Until that happens, we cannot expect L's to X2 their own


X5's with the same X1 as a V. The Φ9 Φ8 Φ7


 


      Read the Φ9 Φ8 Φ6 case and answer the Φ5


Φ4's (on Ψ9's 4 and 5 of the case). What Ψ8's Ψ7'd to this


Ψ6 to Ψ5 Φ7? Ψ4 Ψ3 was Ψ2'd (albeit as a part-time Ψ1 Ψ0)


without having to undergo a Χ9 Χ8. A Χ9


Χ8 might well have Χ7'd a Χ6 of Φ7 or Χ5,


given that he was Χ4'd from his last Χ3. Also, Ψ4 Ψ3 probably


shouldn't have been Ψ2'd in the first place, at least not with a Χ2


Χ1 of his Χ0 Ω9, given that he had just been Χ4'd from a


Ω8 Ω7 at another Ω6. Other Ω5's besides Ψ4 Ψ3


should have been Ω4'd for his first Ω7. When Ψ4 Ψ3 was


Ω3'd to Ω2 for the full-time Ω7, his Ω9 should have been


Ω1'd, especially since it Ω0'd more Ϝ9 than the previous


Ω7. What Ϝ8's in Ϝ7 Ϝ6 could have been Ϝ5'd so that


this Φ7 could have been Ϝ4'd? Ψ4 Ψ3's Ϝ3 Ϝ2 should have been Ϝ1'd as soon as he


was given the full-time Ω7. He no longer Ϝ0'd a Ϝ3 Ϝ2, and


his having such an Ϝ2 gave him ℧9 to ℧8 ℧7. The ℧6 should have ℧5'd to ℧4 ℧3 when ℧3


℧2'd him about the ℧1 that Ψ3 was a ℧0-hire. Ψ3 should


not have been given ℧9 to the ℘9 ℘8-ing pre-ℵ9'd ℘7's. When


℘6 went on ℘5, a more ℘4 ℘3, not a less ℘4 ℘3,


should have been given Ϝ9 for ℘2-ing the ℘1's usually


℘0'd by ℘6. Other than Ψ4 Ψ3, who ℵ8's some Ϝ9 for this Φ7? ℵ7 ℘6, ℵ6 ℵ5 ℵ4, ℵ8's Ϝ9 since


she ℵ3'd ℵ2's ℵ1 on ℧0-based ℵ0's, did not do a Χ9


℧1 on Ψ4 Ψ3, did not Ω4 other Ω5's for the Ω7, and


also did not Ϝ1 Ψ3's Ϝ3 Ϝ2 when he ℌ9 the full-time


Ω7. ℌ8 ℌ7, ℌ6 ℵ6 ℵ5 ℵ4, ℵ8's Ϝ9


since she did not Ϝ1 Ψ3's Ϝ3 Ϝ2. ℌ5 ℌ4, ℧6, ℵ8's Ϝ9 since he ℌ3'd Ψ3 to


ℌ2 to ℌ1 at ℌ0, despite ℌ-ing that Ψ3 was a ℧0-hire. ℋ9 Ψ3 ℵ8's Ϝ9 since she ℋ8'd her ℋ7,


Ψ4 Ψ3, for the Ψ0 Ω7, ℌ-ing that she was ℋ6-ing


ℋ5's ℧0-ℵ1 and also possibly ℌ-ing of Φ7 in her ℋ7's


Χ6. Did the ℧4 ℧3, Ϝ7 ℋ4 ℵ4 do the right ℋ3? Yes. He ℋ2'd the ℧6 to the ℧1 that ℘2-ing Ψ3 was a ℋ1


of ℋ0 ℵ1, and he also successfully ℏ9'd out the ℏ8 of


Ψ3's Φ7, with the end ℏ7 being a ℏ6 on Ψ3's ℏ5. Explain how general ℏ4 Ϝ6's and ℏ3 ℏ2 Ϝ6's


could have ℏ1'd ℏ0 and ℎ9 this Φ7? Ψ3's Ϝ3 Ϝ2 should have been automatically Ϝ1'd once


it was no longer ℎ8. Also, if the ℋ0 had made ℎ7's


ℎ6, instead of through ℎ5 ℘7's, this would not have


ℎ4, at least not in this ℎ3. By 2003, ℎ6 ℎ7's were already


the ℎ2. Additionally, the ℎ1 should (and could) have been ℎ0 up to


automatically ♠ anyone with a Ϝ3's Ϝ2 from having ℧9 to ℘9's


♥-ing ℘7's or other ♦'s, given that anyone with a Ϝ3'sϜ2 can, in ♣, ♢ such ℘7's to himself. A ♧ ♤-ing ♡


 


      You have just been ♠9'd as a Φ7 ♠8 to ♠7 an

♦8 of ♦7. The ♥4's are ♦6'd by the ♦5 and the ♦4 is


♦3'd, which is ♦2'd into the ♦1. The ♥4's ♦0 is ♣9'd


based on ♥0's ♣8'd into the ♦1. The ♥4's ♣7 is ♣6 for


♣5-ing over all ♥0's (♥8, ♣4, ♣3) to the ♣2 at the end of the ♣1. The ♣2 ♣0's the ♢9 ♥0's for the ♣1 to the ♣4's, ♥8 and ♥0's


on ♣3. The ♣2 ♢8's the ♢7 to ♠5's ♢6 who


♢5's a ♢4 ♢3 ♢2 and ♢1's the amount based on ♢0 ♥0's. There is also ♧9 that the ♢6 is ♠0-ing ♥8 before ♢1-ing


the amount into the ♢4 at the end of each ♣1. ♧8 a ♧7 to the ♧6 of the ♠4 ♠3 ♧5-ing the


♧4:


 


      1. ♠7 ♧3's ♧2'd


      2. ♧1 ♧0'd to ♦ the Φ7


      3. ♥ of ♠'s      4. ♣ some Φ4's you would ♢ asking


 


      Re: ♤ Φ7 (♥8 ♠0-ing)


      To whom It May ♧:


 


      My ♠8 is that you ♠1 that two ♣'s of Φ7—


specifically, ♥8 ♠0-ing---are being ♢'d within your Ω6. As you have ♣8'd the ♤ to me, it is ♤ that the two ♣'d


Φ7♣'s are ♠ing, but it is ♤ that they are not. It is also ♤,


and in ♧1 ♣, that if there is in ♧1 Φ7, three ♣'s are ♢'d in it. It is ♤ that these ♣'s are ♢-ing independently of one another; it


is also ♤ that they are ♠ing. I will now ♧ the ♧3's you must ♢ to ♣ that Φ7 is in


♧1 ♧-ing, along with the ♧3's that you must ♢ if it ♣'s out that


Φ7 is ♧-ing. If Φ7 is ♧-ing, these ♧3's will ♠ you to


♣ whether there is ♠ among the ♣'s ♢'d. I will ♣ by ♣8-ing the two Φ7 ♣'s that you ♢ to be


♧-ing, along with some ♦ ♣ ♧1's. Your ♠2 ♢'s ♠4


♥4's, and you ♢ that a ♥4's ♥3 is ♠0-ing some of the ♢


from ♥8-♥0's of those ♠4 ♥4's. Whenever a ♥0 is made, the ♥4's


♦0 is duly ♣9'd. At the end of each ♣, the ♥4's ♥3has to ♣5 over all ♥0's (♥8, ♣4's, and ♣3) to the ♣2, who


♣0's said ♥0's to ♢9 ♥0's (♢'d ♣ ♣'d by their ♣'s). The


♣2 then ♢8's the ♢7 to an ♢6, who ♢1's the


amount of ♢0 ♥0's into the ♢'s ♢4 ♢. For each ♣1 ♣-ing within the ♣ ♣ during which you ♠1


that Φ7 was being ♢'d, ♣ with that ♣1's ♢9 ♥0's (♣ ♢'d


♣ their ♣'s. Then ♣ ♥8, ♣4, and ♣3 ♥0's from that


♢. The amount should be ♣. If it is ♣ than ♣, the next ♧3 is


to ♣ out ♣ ♢ ♣'s. To do this, make sure go over each


♣3 ♣ ♥0, and make sure that the ♣ amount was ♣'d for


the ♣ in Φ4, and do the same with ♣4 ♥0's. If those amounts are


♣, then some of the ♥8 from ♥0's is indeed ♣, and ♥8 is


indeed being ♠0'd. That said, we don't know who is ♠0-ing that ♥8. It could be the


♥4's ♥3 or the ♣2 or both. Moreover, they could either be


♠ing or ♢-ing independently. Below we will ♣ how to


♣ who is ♠0-ing how much. If ♥8 has been ♠0'd thus far in the ♣, it is still ♤ that


the ♢6 is ♠0-ing. At the same ♣, the ♢6 may be


♠0-ing if no ♥8 has been ♠0'd. Either way, the same ♦8 is ♦9'd


to ♣ whether or not the ♢6 is ♠0-ing: simply ♣ the♣2's ♢0 ♣ to the amount that the ♢6 ♢1's. If


♢1's ♣ ♣, then the ♢6 is ♠0-ing. The ♦8 just ♦9'd ♣'s with ♣ ♣'s of ♠0-ing. It is also


♣'d that you ♣ a '♣', so as to ♦ the ♣ of an


on-♣-ing ♣ of Φ7. Two ♣ ♣'s would have to be ♣'d. The


first would ♢ ♣-ing ♢0 ♥0's directly from the ♥4's ♥3 and


♣-ing them against ♢9 ♥0's. If ♥8 ♥0's ♣ ♣, then the ♥4's


♥3 is ♠0-ing. The second ♣ would ♢ ♣-ing


Would you B if we C over the D's with you? There are a


E of F's we'd like you to G up. Would that be H? Are you I that if this J's to K, and you are only L

      The MMMMMM NNNNNN of OOOOO are the PPPPPP QQQQQQ that


RRRRRR's are SSSSSS to have. These TTTTTT:


      *A UUUUUU or VVVVV WWWWW XXXXX: The YYYYY doesn't have a ZZZZ


AAAAA BBBB and can CCC-ize DDD and EEE. *FFF and GGG HHH's with others: The III is JJJ toKKK LLL's of MM-NNN and to not have OO-PPP QQQ and RRR


SSS's. *TTT-UUU: The VVV is WWW to be a XXX. *YYY: The ZZZ is to AAAA his BBB to be more CCC


than the DDD and to EEEE himself to be FFF-er than GGG and also HHH-er


than 'the III.'


        *JJJ-ity and KKK-LLL: The MMM NNN to be OOO and


PPP; and he must be both, QQQ that he has to RRR out both how to SSS


outside the TTT and to UUU the VVV that he is WWW so. b. How did the XXX at YYY ZZZ AAA BBB? The CCC at DDD EEE's FFF GGG-ed HHH. III's were JJJ in KKK, so that LLL-MMM could be NNN-ed. OOO's were PPP-ed to over-QQQ RRR's to SSS TTT's. UUU, VVV's were WWW XXX-ed to do what they could to


YYY ZZZ from the AAA. c. What BBB's of the CCC DDD were EEE at FFF


GGG? HHH's were III in JJJ and therefore KKK the LLL to


MMM and NNN OOO's. PPP's were also QQQ, RRR and SSS


TTT, that UUU-VVV and WWW were XXX, YYY it ZZZ for


them to AAA-ize BBB so. CCC, DDD EEE's had a FFF GGG for HHH III,


JJJ KKK on LLL's to MMM NNN-OOO PPP


they could. d. What do you QQQ to be the most RRR SSS about the


TTT UUU VVV? To me, the most WWW XXX of this YYY was the ZZZ's AAA


to BBB to CCC it. To be DDD, EEE FFF's did GGG-HHH III and


JJJ. But its now KKK LLL MMM's (NNN on OOO:


    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ml6S2yiuSWE) PPP with QQQ


for RRR SSS TTT's and UUU VVV at a WWW of XXX-like


YYY on the ZZZ of its AAA. 3. BBB the following CCC and then DDD EEE's a & b


below :


      FFF you are an GGG HHH for a III, JJJ,KKK LLL with a MMM in NNN. One of your


OOO's is to PPP QQQ's RRR on the SSS's TTT


UUU. When you VVV at WWW one XXX you YYY an ZZZ AAA


was BBB on the CCC that DDD EEE FFF the GGG HHH. "III's JJJ KKK is a LLL MMM," was the NNN OOO PPP


on your QQQ's RRR SSS. TTT is a UUU VVV at your WWW. "XXX. I can't YYY this ZZZ is so AAA," you are BBB as you


CCC some DDD EEE FFF's while GGG up on this HHH


III. The JJJ that KKK your LLL is MMM in NNN 1. A OOO PPP of the QQ RRR SSS a TTT of three UUU's like the


one in VVV 1 (on the WWW XXX of this YYY), all for ZZZ AAA's but


on BBB CCC's. The DDD EEE, FFF, has the GGG to HHH


III of JJJ's for KKK than $10,000. It is LLL to you that the


MMM has a NNN-ed a OOO PPP. You QQQ to RRR that SSS's


TTT UUU is VVV-ed WWW, XXX the YYY ZZZ AAA BBB. There is


no CCC to DDD these EEE's other than the FFF's, all of


which are GGG for HHH III's. The JJJ's KKK is not more than 30 LLL away and MMM can be


NNN at the OOO. You PPP the QQQ's in a RRR, SSS your TTT in the UUU


VVV, and WWW for XXX's YYY. After all, it doesn't ZZZ a AAA BBB to


CCC what's DDD on here. EEE's for FFF 4:


 


      a. Should GGG be HHH-ed and III-ed now? Why or why not? No. It is too JJJ to KKK LLL. MMM-NNN's should not be


OOO-PPP QQQ's. But if RRR were SSS-ed right now, that is what


that TTT would be. It has not yet been UUU-ed that VVV WWW-ed


XXX. It may well be that you are not YYY of ZZZ to AAA the


BBB of these CCC's, but you have only been just DDD EEE of the


FFF, and you must GGG your HHH's before III JJJ. Your KKK right now is to LLL out what MMM. If you NNN your


OOO's, your PPP QQQ is to RRR out what to SSS TTT. Before UUU-ing


VVV, you must WWW XXX what YYY, so that you can ZZZ the


AAA and BBB the CCC of a DDD. When you do EEE, FFF GGG not to go in 'HHH III.' JJJ


an KKK LLL, and MMM with non-NNN OOO's (e.g. how PPP


have you QQQ her?, what is a RRR SSS for you like?). This will TTT


UUU VVV. Once you have 'WWW-ed' with the XXX, YYY to


ZZZ AAA's. b.) BBB a CCC DDD of the EEE's you would FFF in the


GGG with HHH and the III in which they should be JJJ-ed. KKK, your LLL is to MMM whether a NNN has been


OOO-


I can A that B to C into


her D E, I am F of G. If I then H I


J on K's E, I am F L in M to G. G is the N-O of P and Q; and just as R


P an Q is often a S to T, so G is often a


S to L. G may also be a S to a U of other V


W X. Y that I C into Z Ω's Ψ Ewithout her Φ and then Θ her by Λ Π from


her E. Here my Σ of G is a S not to Ξ L, but to


Ο L, this being an extremely Ψ1 Ψ2 of N-Ψ3. Ο L is the A of the W to Θ another Ψ4. In many Ψ5, the Ψ6 of Ο L is Ξ L. For Ψ7,


Ψ8 may H Ψ9's Ο with the Ψ10 of Ψ11 Ψ9's Ψ12


E. But Ξ L is not always what Ο L is about. Ψ8


may H Ψ9's Ο with the Ψ10 of Ψ13 his Ψ14 (by


Λ I Π to his Ψ15 from his Ψ16 E) or of


Ψ17 him (by Ψ18 Ψ19 Ψ20 on his R Ψ21


E's). W Ψ22 is the A of the W to Ψ23 Ψ22. Each of the


N's Ψ24 in the first Ψ25 is a Ψ26 of W Ψ22. The


W is a Ψ27 for Ψ28's since it Ψ29's practically Ψ30 to


Ψ31 practically any Ο. A Ψ32 can Ψ33 to be a Ψ34; an Ψ35


can Ψ33 to be a Ψ36; a Ψ37 can Ψ33 to be a Ψ38 Ψ39. One particularly Ψ40 Ψ2 of W Ψ22 is W Ψ41


Ψ22. Ψ30 will Ψ42 a Ψ43 Ψ44 on a Ψ45 Ψ46, such as


Ψ47.Ψ48. If the Ψ28's Ψ49 is to Ψ50 Ψ51 Ψ52's, he or she


may Ψ42 a Ψ53 of an extremely Ψ54-Ψ55 Ψ51 Ψ34 who is Ψ56


to Ψ57 a 'Ψ58 Ψ59 to have Ψ60 with.' If the Ψ61 is Ψ62 Ψ63's, theΨ28 is likely to Ψ42 a Ψ53 of a Ψ64 Ψ55 Ψ65 who


Ψ66's to Ψ67 'a Ψ68 Ψ34 who isn't simply after my Ψ69.' When


Ψ30 Ψ70's, an W Ψ71 Ψ72's, during which the Ψ28


Ψ73 Ψ74's the other Ψ4's Ψ75. Eventually, the Ψ28 will Ψ76 to


Ψ77 on that Ψ75 by Ψ78 the other Ψ4 in some Ψ79. Here is a Ψ80-Ψ81 Ψ7. Ψ82 Ψ83 and Ψ84 Ψ85 Ψ86-ed a


Ψ43 Ψ44 on an W Ψ45 Ψ87, Ψ88 to be a Ψ89 and


Ψ64 Ψ39. Ψ90 through this Ψ91, Ψ83 and Ψ85


Ψ92-ed Ψ93 Ψ94's with Ψ95 V Ψ96, Ψ97 them


into Ψ98 this Ψ99-Ψ100 Ψ4 to Ψ101 their Ψ69, thereby


Ψ102 Ψ103's of Ψ104's of Ψ105's from them. These Ψ96 Ψ106-ed the


Ψ107's, who quickly Ψ108-ed the Ψ69. Ψ83 and Ψ85 were Ψ109-ed


and Ψ110-ed of Ψ95 Ψ111's of W Ψ22 and Ψ112 Ψ22. The Ψ113's in this Ψ26 did not Ψ114 Ψ115 Ψ116. They Ψ117 their


Ψ69 to Ψ30 without first Ψ118 his Ψ119's or even his very


Ψ120. Ψ83 and Ψ85 were Ψ121's, not Ψ122's, and their


Ψ113's Ψ123 Ψ117 them every Ψ124 that they Ψ125 from them, and they


would have Ψ126-ed this Ψ127 had they simply A-ed their Ψ128. W Ψ22, like all Ψ22, Ψ129's Ψ130 Ψ131 of Ψ132 Ψ133,


and as long as one Ψ134's Ψ135, instead of Ψ136, one won't be the


Ψ113 of W Ψ22. Most Ψ137 have been the Ψ113's of some Ψ138 of W Ψ22. They may have Ψ117 Ψ69 to a Ψ139 Ψ140 to Ψ141 them Ψ142


Ψ143-at-Ψ144 Ψ145's. They may have Ψ146-ed up Ψ117 Ψ69 to Ψ93


'Ψ147's' who never Ψ148-ed them with Ψ149 Ψ150's. They may


have been Ψ151-ed an Ψ93 'Ψ152' for Ψ153 Ψ154 that they never Ψ155-ed. Or they may have Ψ146-ed up for Ψ43 Ψ156-Ψ157-Ψ158 Ψ159's Ψ160-ed by


Ψ161 Ψ162's. The Ψ113's of these Ψ163's are always Ψ132 Ψ164's:


they are Ψ137 who Ψ165 to Ψ166 that they can H $Ψ167,Ψ168 Ψ169


Ψ170 Ψ171's/Ψ172; that a Ψ173 Ψ152 will Ψ141 them Ψ174 for $Ψ175; that the


Ψ176 will simply Ψ141 them Ψ69; that, in Ψ177, they can have what


they Ψ165 without Ψ169 for it. All W Ψ22 Ψ129's Ψ132 Ψ133,


and a Ψ178 Ψ179 of Ψ180 H's one Ψ181 to it. One virtually Ψ182-Ψ183 Ψ184 that an Ψ93 'Ψ185 Ψ186' is a


Ψ187 is that one has to Ψ188 for it. Ψ173 Ψ189's Ψ188 you; you don't Ψ188


them. If you are being Ψ190-ed to Ψ188 Ψ69 to H Ψ69, you are being


Ψ191-ed out of your Ψ69 and also quite possibly being Ψ192-ed into


Ψ193 B to Ψ30 who will Ψ76 to A it to Ψ194 you


further. To be sure, W Ψ22 is only one Ψ138 of N, but W


Ψ22 Ψ195's to be Ψ196-ed in Ψ197 out other Ψ138's of N's. If


Ψ30 is able to H your Ο or C into an E of yours, thereis a Ψ198 Ψ199 that he Ψ192-ed you into Ψ200 him R Ψ201. He


may have Ψ202-ed you on Ψ203 and Ψ73 Ψ204-ed you into Ψ200 him


R Ψ201, or he may have Ψ205 you an Ψ16 Ψ206 you with the Ψ207


of Ψ208 Ψ69 into Ψ209 up an E on a Ψ46 of his. It is likely that


some Ψ210 of Ψ132 Ψ133 on your Ψ211 was Ψ196-ed in this Ψ4's


being in a Ψ212 to Ψ213 the B that Ψ214-ed to C into your


E's and H your Ο. There are indeed N's that do not Ψ215 W Ψ22 and


therefore do not Ψ215 Ψ132 Ψ133 on the Ψ113's Ψ211. In some Ψ26's,


Ψ216 or Ψ217 E's are Ψ218-ed, and the Ψ113 isn't F of any


Ψ219 Ψ220 in Ψ128. But Ψ221 of such Ψ26's Ψ195's to Ψ222 that the


Ψ113 Ψ223 too much Ψ224 in Ψ30 (it may have been a Ψ161 Ψ225 or


an Ψ226-ed Ψ227-Ψ228 on Ψ229) and Ψ230-ed their Ψ231 to that Ψ4. It is


very Ψ232 that one's Ψ217 E will be Ψ218-ed or one's Ο Ψ233


unless one has been too Ψ234 to Ψ141 Ψ235 to Ψ236 Ψ237's without


Ψ238 Ψ119's. To be sure, Ψ239's often have Ψ240 to R B,


and they may A that B to Ψ23 N's against those


Ψ137. For Ψ7, Ψ241's may have Ψ240 to Ψ242 Ψ243 Ψ244


B, and they could A that B to Ψ23 L or Ψ22. But Ψ241's Ψ245 their Ψ246's too much to Ψ247 them away for a fewΨ248-ed Ψ243 Ψ244 J's, the same being true of all Ψ239's:


Ψ249's, Ψ250's, Ψ251's, and Ψ252's Ψ253 to Ψ254 much and


Ψ255 little by Ψ256 Ψ257 B. If a Ψ258 Ψ4 does have an


Ψ259 to Ψ260 up Ψ248-ed Ψ261's on your Ψ243 Ψ244, he probably


isn't a Ψ239, and he probably is Ψ30 who could not have


Ψ262-ed that B without Ψ263. In Ψ264, although there are W Ψ163's that do not Ψ215


Ψ22 or Ψ265, most such Ψ163's do, and the best Ψ266 against


W Ψ163 is to A one's Ψ128. Ψ267 Ψ30's Ψ119's before


Ψ200 Ψ30 your R B, let alone your Ψ69, and Ψ268


the Ψ269 if you are unable to Ψ267 their Ψ119's. Ψ22 Ψ270 Ψ271's


 


      The Ψ6 of any Ψ270 is to Ψ272 B from the Ψ4


being Ψ273-ed. This is especially Ψ274 to do, when the Ψ6 of the


Ψ270 is to Ψ272 B about a Ψ163 that the Ψ275 is Ψ276


or Ψ277-ed to have Ψ278-ed. Consequently, Ψ30 Ψ279 a Ψ22


Ψ280 Ψ270 has to Ψ281 Ψ282's that other Ψ270's do not. First of all, the Ψ283 must Ψ284 the Ψ285's. He must Ψ284 what


Ψ138 of Ψ22 has Ψ278-ed and what it Ψ296-ed; and he must also Ψ284


what the likely Ψ297 is of the Ψ4 is being Ψ273-ed. If the Ψ283


doesn't have this B, he will be 'Ψ287' for B and the


Ψ275 will Ψ284 it, Ψ288 the Ψ289 even more Ψ290 than he


would otherwise be to be Ψ291 Ψ292. Also, the Ψ275 is likely to


'Ψ293 Ψ294' such Ψ283 with Ψ295 or Ψ296-Ψ292 Ψ297's, which will


Ψ298 the Ψ283 from Ψ299 on the Ψ300 Ψ301's and Ψ302 the Ψ300


Ψ303's. To be sure, the Ψ283 need not Ψ284 all of the


This

involves having the G's and Q-ing what to R. But it also S's not

having an T: not U-ing the V either as W or a X,

but simply as a possible Y of Z who is to be AA-ed

accordingly. Some Key BB's to CC DD EE FF GG


 


      There are several BB's to HH-ing an CC DD EE FF

GG of a given II. First of all, a JJ KK of the

LL in MM is a NN for CC DD EE FF GG. Suppose that ACME is a OO that PP's QQ RR-ed and

SS-TT UU VV's. It might be very WW for an XX

YY (or any other ZZ AAA) to know exactly what BBB's of DD

ACME CCC's might be DDD to EE. Suppose that ACME FFF's

GGG HHH's of III JJJ. Because of KKK-ing LLL MMM's, it

might be NNN for OOO-PPP's to QQQ RRR and, on this

SSS, to TTT off UUU for themselves. In this VVV, CC DD EE

FF would WWW XXX of how to YYY ZZZ UU

AAAA's BBBB-ing III CCCC's, which would DDDD XXX

that is more EEEE-FFFF than most YY's are DDD to have. Second, a JJ KK of the OO in MM is

GGGG for CC DD EE HHH. Suppose once again that

ACME PP's RR UU VV's, often WWW-ing III

CCCC's. Also suppose that there are IIII JJJ-PPP's KKKK-ing

each of ACME's LLLL MMM's. (So if Smith is one of ACME's NNNN's,

then ten LLLL JJJ-PPP's are WWWW in KKKK-ing Smith's MMM.)It will be WW to know exactly who is OOOO-ing what for a given NNNN, and it

will therefore be PPPP to know who has QQQQ to what BBB of Z or,

therefore, who is in a RRRR to EE a given BBB of DD. If SSSS TTTT's

UUUU-ing from one of Smith's MMM's, there will be ten LLLL ACME

CCC's to VVVV, WWWW-ing it PPPP to XXXX a YYYY and CC

ZZZZ. Third, even if a given YY (or AAAAA BBBBB) has the CCCCC

DDDDD of LL-EEEEE and OO-EEEEE Z, a FFFFF

SSSSS DDDDD of GGGGG may be HHHHHH to IIIII all of the JJJJJ KKKKK in

MM. Suppose that ACME is an QQ GGGGG OO that PP's

IIII LLLL BBB's of VV's in IIII LLLL MMMMM's. In a NNNNN like, it

would be PPPP to XXXX an OOOOO PPPPP ZZZZ of each QQQQ RRRRR

of ACME, since the SSSSS and TTTTT WWWW would be UUUUU, as would

the VVVVV in YYY-ing the WWWWW Z; and it would

probably be GGGG to come up with a OO-XXXXX DD EE

FF YYYYY. But ZZZZ-ing up with such an FF would be an

AAAAAA QQ BBBBBB CCCCCC. Fourth, IIII OO's, especially OO's in the DDDDDD's of EEEEEE

and FFFFFF, GGGGGG VV's that are HHHHHH IIIIII. Suppose that ACME

PP's 'JJJJJJ HHH KKKKKK', ACME CCC's might LLLLL

ZZZ MMMMMM's that their NNNN's are NNNNN to OOOOO, WWWW-ing itNNN to PPPPP for VV's that were never QQQQQ. Also, those VV's

might WWW RRR-ing SSSS MMM's or even SSSS TTTTT OO's, which

could then be used to UUUUU hide VVVV's or WWWW's or simply to hide UUU's. Fifth, while XXX-ing LL-EEEEE and OO-EEEEE

KK, DD EE FF must also be HHH-ed by YYYYY-ed

ZZZZZZ, and this S's it AAAAAA WW to XXXX CC DD EE

FF. It is PPPP for any II to be BBBBBB about itself and

therefore to CCCCCC DD in its own DDDDDD, but it is PPPP for ZZ EEEEEEE


FFFFFF ZZ EEEEEEE of the Z HHHHHH to do so. Finally, when HHH-ing a DD EE FF, it is GGGG to

GGGGG in HHHH what the OO will actually be IIIIII and JJJJJJ to do with

the WWWWW Z. Suppose that Smith is an KKKKKK YY who

XXXX's a DD EE FF of ACME, and suppose that the ACME-

VV's that Smith LLLLL's as DDD to MMMM to DD are the very ones that

ACME NNNNN's on for most of its OOOOO. In that NNNNN, Smith's PPPPPP may

well QQQQQ on RRRRR SSSSS. In TTTTT to UUUU this, Smith would have to be very

VVVVV about how exactly the VV's in MM might MMMM to DD, and he

would also have to be very VVVVV about how to those VV's could be

WWWWW while also being so XXXXX or YYYYYY that they were no ZZZZZ

DD-AAAAAAA. In a BBBBBB like this, DD EE FF would WWW

a SSSSS-DDDDD of KK, BBBBBBB, and CCCCCC. In DDDDDDD, CC DD EE FF EEEEE's a FFFFFFFF

of OO-Z, LL-Z, BBBBBB, and CCCCCC

that may WWWW it WW to GGGGGG out HHHHHH. Five IIIIII's of JJJJJJ CCC's


 

                                                                          [71]
      In her KKKKKK Five IIIIII's of a LLLLL MMMM NNNNN, Erin


Schreiner OOOOOO's what she PPPPP's to be some GGGG QQQQQQ's for a


LLLLL MMMM NNNNN, these being:


 


      RRRRR and SSSSS


      TTTTT to the UUUUU


        VVVVV that doesn't WWWWW


        XXXXX and YYYYY


        ZZZZZ-AAAAAAA BBBBBBB


 


      Let us CCCCCCC DDDDD each of these:


 


        RRRRR and SSSSS: An CCC is only as LLLLL as he is


EEEEEEE. The most FFFFFFF GGGGGG in the HHHHH is IIIIIII to the JJJJJJJ that


KKKKKK's him if he doesn't LLLLLLL up to MMMM NNNNNNN. In OOOOOO, as this very


PPPPPPP QQQQQ's, if someone who has RRRRRRR is SSSSSSS, that can be a


TTTTTTT BBBBBB: given that the GGGGGG in MM is RRRRRRR, the


JJJJJJJ will UUUUUU him to do that much more than his VVVVVVV; and if he


doesn't LLLLLLL to MMMM, then that much more MMMM isn't being done. TTTTT to the UUUUU: It isn't WWWWWW that KKKKKK's LLLLLLL up and do


their UUUUU. It is GGGG that they do their UUUUU with XXXXXXX. A RRRRRRR


GGGGGG who LLLLLLL's up to MMMM but doesn't YYYYYYY himself is not only ZZZZZZ


to AAAAAAA his II but is BBBBBBBB CCCCCCC it. VVVVV that doesn't WWWWW: A DDDDDDD and EEEEEEE CCC is a


EEEEEEE CCC; an CCC who isn't DDDDDDD or EEEEEEE is not a


EEEEEEE CCC. So VVVVV, though not exactly a BBBBBBB-FFFFFFFFF in


and of itself, is a GGGGGGG of the first two BBBBBBB-HHHHHHH's. XXXXX and YYYYY: It isn't WWWWWW that an CCC be


IIIIIII and EEEEEEE. If he doesn't JJJJJJJ with the II that


KKKKKK's him, then his KKKKKKK's won't be its KKKKKKK's. Such a LLLLLLL may


be a MMMMM NNNNNNN; but if he is OOOOOO of a PPPPP, then he QQQQQ as such. And even if he is an NNNNNNN, he still has to MMMM with RRRRR—with


SSSSSSS, TTTTTTT, UUUUUUU, and CCC's of his own—and he must, in


that VVVVV, be a PPPPP-WWWWWW. So XXXXXXX with one's PPPPP is YYYYYY


for KKKKKKK in any ZZZZZ that is not AAAAAA BBBBBBBB. ZZZZZ-AAAAAAA BBBBBBB: In TTTTT for a LLLLLLL to have any of theCCCCCC DDDDDDD EEEEE's, he must be ZZZZZ-AAAAAAA. Someone who is not


ZZZZZ-AAAAAAA is a 'FFFFFFF', and FFFFFFF's are neither EEEEEEE, PPPP-GGGGGG,


DDDDDDD, or EEEEEEE; and they are not LLLLL PPPPP-HHHHHHH's. So ZZZZZ-


IIIIII is, in a JJJJ, the KKKKKK-LLLLLLL of all of the MMMMM


IIIIII's of a LLLLL NNNNNNN. The "So What?" About your LL OOOOOOO (PPPPPPP)

But X seems to be


insinuating that, if there were an actual connection between Y-ing about (or


Z-ing about) violence and W-ing acts of violence, then these


distinguished authors would have V-ed clear of such literature. But if that is


what X is saying—and it must be what he is saying, unless (what is


possible) his inclusion of this material serves no argumentative purpose—then X's reasoning is weak, to put it mildly. Taken by itself, X's main claim—that decades of research have


turned


      up no reliable causal link between playing violent video games and


R-ing actual violence"---is perfectly plausible. And it may even be


true. But the data that X himself sites does not support the belief that


there is no such connection. In fact, that data doesn't even support the much


more modest claim that "decades of research" have failed to produce such


data. Given only what X says—given only the data that he sites---it


seems as though scientific research has generated data suggestive of a link


between virtual and actual violence. In fact, given the totality of the data that


X himself sites, it would be epistemically more conservative to affirm


than to deny the existence of such a link. In conclusion, while it may be there


is no such link, X's article fails utterly to prove otherwise. Throughout the article, X seems to be insinuating that people are


guilty of some sort of prejudice---of some failure to look at their personal


values in light of the actual facts—in holding there to be a causal connection


between virtual and actual violence. X's 'position', if that isn't too


strong a word, seems to be that, although people attach a negative value to


violent games, there is no reason for them to do so, the facts being what they


are. There are several points to make here. First, the facts being what they


are, there is reason to hold there to be such a connection. Are there definitive


reasons? No. But is there more reason than not to posit such a link? Probably. Second, to the extent that Grand Theft Auto and other such games are


held in contempt, is it not necessarily solely or even primarily because those


games are suspected of promoting violence. Another possibility—a very


distinct possibility—is that people see it as a waste of time to spend all day


playing video games. Indeed, people don't have much respect for people who


spend all day playing Grand Theft Auto. But they have equally little respect


for people who spend all day playing Pac Man or Galaga. Video games have


their place, but they tend to function as ways for people to procrastinate and


avoid the real world. And so far as gaming is held in contempt, that is


probably way. Going on a A-style shooting spree is one way of being a


loser. Spending all day playing video games is another of being a loser. Third, judging by video game sales, it doesn't seem that there is any


particular societal contempt for gaming. Who buys those games after all? Not


the people who use them---they don't have money. 15 year old rarely have


enough money of their own buy much of anything. And when they purchase


video games, it is with their parents' money (and knowledge: the parents


obviously see their children playing those games and know that they were


purchased with allowance-money). So it is, in effect, their parents who arebuying those games. So by all accounts, the contingent of anti-gamers that


X is Q-ing against is rather small. Moreover, given only the data that


X sites, that contingent is not completely without good reasons for


thinking ill of virtual recreational violence. This raises a larger question, namely: Do the facts ever justify


valuative attitudes? According to David Hume, the answer is "no." "One


cannot derive an 'ought' from an 'is'", says Hume. But is that really true? If know that Smith is dumping large quantities


of poison in the local reservoir—if I am aware of that fact---do I not have an


obligation to alert the authorities and to make people aware of the fact that


their water supply has been contaminated? It seems that, in this case, unless


common sense is deeply wrong, I can derive an 'ought' (I ought to tell the


police about Smith's behavior) from an 'is' (Smith is dumping poison in the


water supply). In general, it seems as though normative assertions are answerable to


factual assertions. Let A be the statement:


 


      Jim hurts people for no good reason; it doesn't even make him feel


good; it just gives him mild sadistic pleasure. And let B be the statement: 


      Jim is evil or, at the very least, lacking in moral fiber. It seems that, given A, B cannot reasonably be denied—that there is a


relation of entailment from A to B. If Hume believes otherwise, it is, at least


on the face of it, Hume's position that is to be rejected. In any case, X's reasoning is so weak that it doesn't much matter


what 'ought' he is saying you should, or should not, derive from what 'is.'


X has cited some data, the totality of which is compatible with, and


mildly probative of, a causal nexus between virtual and actual violence. (Personally, I don't believe there to be such a connection. But X,


ironically, has actually done more to prove there to be such a connection than


to disprove it.) So is X saying that, the data being what it is, we should


not derive "you ought not prohibit youngsters from playing Grand Theft


Auto" from that data? Or is he saying that we should derive "you ought to let


youngsters play Theft Auto" from that data? It doesn't matter. Because


X's argument is so weak, and the data he cites so ambiguous, that it is


left open what, if anything, is to be derived from what. Why Barings Fell (Business/Economics)


 


      To: Audit Committee of a Commercial Bank


      Re: Risk Factors and Control Issues Contributing to the Downfall of


Barings Bank


 


      The basic facts of the B case are simple. An unlicensed 25-year-


old broker, B was hired by Barings and placed in charge of its futures


trading operation on the Singapore International Monetary Exchange

          [72]
(SIMEX). B was hard-working and bold, and he initially made


enormous amounts of money for Barings by making large, highly successful


trades. These trades were highly speculative, this being why they were so


lucrative. They were also unauthorized. B went to great lengths to make


the trades seem legitimate. He created a dummy account (Account #88888)


for a non-existent client, through which he routed money from other Barings


accounts to finance his unauthorized trades, and he created an elaborate

 
phony paper trail to throw off auditors. After a few early successes,B's

 [73]
luck ran out. He placed bad trade after bad trade, K-ing up the books


to hide the losses from Baring's auditors and also from his supervisors. The


auditors were increasingly alarmed by the holes they found in B's


financials, but B's supervisors, still believing B to be a successfulearner, dismissed their concerns. In 1995, an earthquake in Japan caused the


Nikkei to plummet, resulting in losses for B that he could not hide and


that exposed his operation for the house of cards that it was. He fled but was


promptly captured, tried, convicted, and incarcerated. Barings made several mistakes in connection with B, the first of


which was to hire him in the first place. B was denied a broker's license


in the United Kingdom because he had lied on his application, claiming that

                                                            [74]
he had educational credentials that he in fact lacked. Given that B


was applying for a job at Barings that would involve him handling other


people's money, the people reviewing his application should have regarded


this indiscretion on his part as disqualifying from that position. This was a


violation of Principles 1 of Component 1 of COSO 2013: "Principle 1 - The

                                                                        [75]
organization adheres to the principles of integrity and ethics." A company


is obviously failing to adhere to principles of integrity and ethics if it hires


somebody who lies on official paperwork and then gives him person a


position of fiduciary responsibility. Another big mistake Barings made in connection with B was to


put him in charge not only of making trades but also of settling them (i.e. of

                                                                              [76]
seeing to it that the money is transferred from account to account). Ordinarily, these two jobs are kept separate, so as to prevent the making of


unauthorized trades and also to prevent traders from being able to hide theirtrading activity. This is a violation of COSO 2017 Principle #10, this being to

                                            [77]
identify possible risk-factors for fraud. In addition, when Barings internal


auditors began to sound the alarm about B's numbers not adding up,


management always took B's word on the matter, this being a violation


of COSO 2017 Principle #16, this being to review risky behavior and

              [78]
performance. A giant red flag in the B case was when it turned out that B


would have needed approximately 70 million pounds (worth over one


hundred million dollars) to finance his trades, this being an amount far in

                                                                      [79]
excess of what any trader could possibly have had access to. B gave a


brief and vague explanation to his supervisor. The supervisor was puzzled by


B's inadequate explanation but chose to look the other way. Indeed,


there were several occasions when one of B's supervisors was contacted


by an auditor asking for paperwork relating to B's trades; and in each


case, the supervisor, being personally chummy with B and also still


under the spell of his charm and earlier successes, chose to look the other


way. B's crooked behavior was ultimately not motivated by financial


pressure. He made his first known unauthorized trade to cover up a minor


loss; but after making good on that loss, he continued, while under absolutely


no financial pressure, to make unauthorized trade after unauthorized trade,indicating that his behavior was not about his circumstances but about his


character. The question is not why he did it (he was crook, who had run afoul


of regulators before working for Barings and was acting accordingly). Nor is


it how he rationalized his behavior. (Criminals don't always have to


rationalize their conduct; and when they do, the rationalizations can be thin


ones, along the lines of 'Barings has more money than it knows what do with,


so I'm entitled to my fair share'). As far as the Fraud Triangle goes, the


relevant question here is how B did what he did; and the answer is that


he was in charge of settling the trades he was making, which gave him the


power to generate a phony paper trail and thereby keep internal auditors off


his track, at least until the scam collapsed. Internet Crime (Computer Security)


 


        'Computer crime' is a veritable synonym of 'internet crime.' Internet


crime always involves the internet. But there are two very different kinds of


crimes that involve the internet. In some cases, the internet is being used in


an honest manner but with the intention of committing a crime. In other


cases, the internet is being used in a dishonest manner, and that is the crime. Here is an example of the first kind of crime. I go to a drug website


and purchase a controlled substance. The merchant in question sends me


what I bought; the product is good; and the quantity is what I asked for. In


this case, I am not committing fraud and neither is the merchant. But a crime


has been committed. Here is an example of the second kind of crime. I send out emails in


which I claim to be a representative of Bank America.
