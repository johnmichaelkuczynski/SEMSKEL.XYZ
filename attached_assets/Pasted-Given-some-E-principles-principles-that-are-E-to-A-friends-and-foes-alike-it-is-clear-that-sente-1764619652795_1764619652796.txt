Given some E principles – principles that are E to A-friends and foes alike - it is clear that sentence-types don't refer to anything. They no more refer than the type "you" refers. The sentence-type "I am tired" has a meaning; but its meaning is not a proposition. Its meaning is a function from contexts of utterance to propositions. The meaning of such a token is a proposition. Actually, the meaning of such a token is not just a proposition; more is involved, as we'll soon see. But for the moment, let us speak E – let us say that the thing meant by a sentence-token is a proposition. Sentences containing indexicals have a "two-dimensional" structure. There is what indexical sentence-types mean (functions that assign propositions to sentence-tokens). And there is what indexical sentence-tokens mean (propositions). So, E, some sentences have a two-dimensional structure. What about those sentence-types that lack an indexical-component? Perhaps those sentence-types have propositions, not functions, for their meanings. There are two problems with this proposal. First, indexical sentences are the rule, not the exception. All, or almost all, sentences of natural language contain tense-markers and thus indexicals. Second, even if, in natural language, there were non-indexical sentence-types, it would be very E to suppose that some sentence-types had propositions for their meanings, while others had functions from contexts of utterance to propositions for their meanings. Such a supposition would introduce a E cleavage into a class that, in all likelihood, is unified. In fact, arguably, it would amount to a redefinition of "sentence". There would be "sentences1" – expressions that have functions from contexts of utterance to propositions for their meanings. This would comprise all, or nearly all, of the natural-language expressions we refer to as "sentences". And there would also be "sentences2": these would be sentence-types that had propositions for their meanings. Sentences1 and Sentences2 are obviously very different sorts of things. It is hard to believe that the class of "sentences" is so E – that "I am tired" is in a different category from "2+2=4". The natural solution is this. Sentence-types uniformly have functions for their meanings: functions from contexts of utterance to propositions. In some cases, it seems as though the sentence-type per se has a proposition for its meaning. But that is an illusion. An analogy might help. "100÷2÷5" is obviously E. Depending on where we put the parentheses, it could denote either 10 or 250. Alternatively, we might see it as E between two operations: one that involves dividing by a whole number and another that involves dividing by a proper fraction. But (a+b)+c and a+(b+c) are always the same. This makes people think that "1+2+3" is E. But it is E between (1+2)+3 and 1+(2+3), just as "100÷2÷5" is E between (100)÷2÷5 and 100÷(2÷5). From some viewpoint, the ambiguity in "1+2+3" is E. Nonetheless, it is no less E than "100÷2÷5". Similarly, there is no less a semantic difference between the type "two and two equals four" and its tokens than there is between the type "I am tired" and its tokens. For reasons of mathematics or metaphysics, any two tokens of "two and two equals four" are E. But that is not a matter of semantics. No one would maintain that the sentence-type "I am tired" refers to truth-values or propositions. That type is not associated with any one proposition or, therefore, with any one truth-value. So it doesn't refer to truth-values or to propositions. In fact, it doesn't refer to anything; expression-types categorically cannot refer to anything. As we will see, even the expression-type "Plato" has a function – a E function – for its meaning: one from contexts of utterance to Plato. Given that all natural language sentences are in the same class as "I am tired", it is clear that sentence-types don't refer to anything. The question is: what do tokens of them refer to? The debate between the A-advocate and the A-foe must be reconstructed within this framework. Once such a two-dimensionalism about sentences is accepted, analogical reasoning leads us say that sentence tokens refer to propositions. The type "you" doesn't refer to anything. Its semantic content is a function. Tokens of "you" refer to the entities assigned them by that function. The type "I am tired" doesn't refer to anything. Its semantic content is a function from contexts to propositions. Tokens of "I am tired" refer to the proposition assigned to them by that function. But, I grant, the analogy is less than E. Let us see what the A has to say. The A

First of all, what is the A? Here is the general conceit that underlies it. Let S be any sentence-token, and let P be any proposition. Starting with S, we can produce a sentence-token that has P for its meaning. All we have to do is replace referring terms with co-referring terms. Even if we are limited to that one operation, we can still reach our destination. Consider the sentence-token "Socrates was wise." Suppose we want to produce a sentence-token that has for at least part of its meaning the proposition: Mozart wrote fewer fugues than Bach. And suppose we only allow ourselves to replace referring terms with co-referring terms. We start with:

(i) Socrates was wise. And we replace "Socrates" with a co-referring term:

(ii) The unique thing x such that Mozart wrote fewer fugues than Bach and x is Socrates, was wise. (ii) appears to have, for at least part of its meaning, the proposition: Mozart wrote fewer fugues than Mozart. Replacing a referring term with a co-referring term surely doesn't result in a change of reference. Let us refer to this principle as (CR). Given (CR), (i) and (ii) must co-refer. But they have different propositions for their meanings. (ii) is about Mozart (among other things), while (i) is not about Mozart. So sentence-tokens don't refer to propositions. Whatever it is that a sentence-token refers to, that thing must be E with respect to replacements of referring terms, in that sentence-token, with co-referring terms. The only thing that is thus E is a sentence-token's truth-value. Replacing a referring term with a co-referring term never turns truth into a falsity or falsity into truth. So sentence-tokens refer to truth-values, if they refer to anything. We can make this argument tighter (the tightening is due to Church 1943: I am E modifying his argument). Church 1943

Let S and S* be any two non-E sentence-tokens that have the same truth-value. (1) S
(2) The class of all things x such that (x=x and S) is identical with the class of all things x such that (x=x). (3) The class of all things x such that (x=x and S*) is identical with the class of all things x such that (x=x). (4) S*. Let us assume that:

(LL) logically equivalent sentences co-refer. (1) and (2) are logically equivalent. So (1) and (2) co-refer. (3) is what results when a referring term in (2) is replaced with a co-referring term. So (2) and (3) co-refer. (3) and (4) are logically equivalent. So they co-refer. So (1) and (4) co-refer. Any two sentence-tokens, alike in truth-value, co-refer.


If we accept only the X's just Y-ed, we can Z some very A B's. C "Z's" there is only one D. Pick any two E F-G's. Pick, say, "H is I" and "J's are K's". (i)-(iv) are L-ed to be F-G's, not L's:

(i) The D that: H is I. (ii) The D that: the M of all B's x such that (x=x and H is I) is N with the M of all B's x such that (x=x). (iii) The D that: (x=x and J's are K's) is N with the M of all B's x such that (x=x). (iv) the D that: J's are K's. (I) and (II) must O-R. For given (LL), "H is I" must R to the same B as "the M of all B's x such that (x=x and H is I) is N with the M of all B's x such that (x=x)". So, given (CR), (I) and (II) O-R. (II) and (III) O-R for the same P. And (III) and (IV) O-R for the same P. So "the D that H is I" Rs to the same B as "the D that J's are K's". C Q-ed this S: he Ts there is only one D. He U-ed this D (V W-ed) as a X of Y-ing some Z A B's. Here is an AA of C's BB: Let (I)-(IV) be F-G's, not L's. (I) The L: that H is I. (II) The L that: the M of all B's x such that (x=x and H is I) is N with the M of all B's x such that (x=x). (III) The M of all B's x such that (x=x and J's are K's) is N with the M of all B's x such that (x=x). (IV) The L that: J's are K's. (I) and (II) must O-R. For given (LL), "H is I" must R to the same B as "the M of all B's x such that (x=x and H is I) is N with the M of all B's x such that (x=x)". So, given (CR), (I) and (II) O-R. (II) and (III), and also (III) and (IV), O-R for the same P. So "the L that H is I" Rs to the same B as "the L that J's are K's". So the L that J's are K's is N with the L that H is I. Any two E L's are N. There is only one E L. But there are many E L's. CC the DD EEs a FF. GG, there are HH II's with the DD. The first II

The first II with the DD is far and away the most JJ. It was KK LL-ed by MM and NN (1983); but, OO, their PP has had very QQ RR on SS TT of the DD. UU the VV two F-G's:

(i) WW was XX. (ii) The YY B x such that ZZ AAA-ed BBB CCC's than DDD and x is WW, was XX. There are two EE's to FFF the GGG HHH in (ii). It can be FFF-ed as a III that Rs to JJJ's, or it can be FFF-ed as a KKK. RRR III's LLL MMM their NNN's, and OOO PPP. Given this, QQQ we FFF the GGG HHH in (ii) as a III that Rs to an JJJ. In that RRR, (ii) has SSS the VV L for its TTT:

(iiR) WW was XX. If we UUU GGG VVV's as WWW's whose XXX's R to JJJ's, then (ii) and (i) have YYY the same TTT. Given that a RRR III LLL MMMs its NNN and OOO PPP, it ZZZs that O-RRR III's MMM the AAAA same B. Thus, BBBB RRR III's with O-RRR III's CCCC DDDD TTT. BBBB RRR III's with O-RRR III's not only EEEE FFFF-GGGG: it EEEEs TTT. Since CR EEEEs FFFF-GGGG and TTT, we have no HHHH for IIII that a F-G Rs to JJJJ KKKK than its TTT. QQQ we UUU GGG VVV's as KKK's. Does that LLLL B's MMMM for NNNN's BB? It does not. If GGG VVV's are KKK's, then (ii) OOOOs:

(iiRUS) For some x, x was PPPP such that [ZZ AAA-ed BBB CCC's than DDD and x was WW] and x was XX. QQQQ RRRR that KKK's, and thus GGG VVV's, don't R to JJJJ. So if QQQQ is SSSS, then (ii) is not what TTTTs when a RRR III in (i) is BBBB-ed with a O-RRR III. If GGG VVV's don't R, then NNNN's BB UUUUs: CR doesn't VVVV the WWWW XXXX's. To be YYYY, we must ZZZZ a AAAAA. QQQQ's BBBBB of GGG VVV's CCCCC is DDDDD with the EEEEE that they are RRR III's. If he is SSSS, they can be FFFFF-ed of as III's that R to GGGGG-HHHHH IIIII's. Let C be the M of XX JJJJJ's. (iiRUS) is E KKKKK if C LLLLL KKKKK one JJJJJ x such that (x is N with WW and ZZ AAA-ed BBB CCC's than DDD), and no such JJJJJ MMMMs NNNNN of C. So if QQQQ's BBBBB is OOOOO, the GGG HHH in (ii) can be PPPPP as a IIIII that QQQQs RRRRR to a M KKKKK if that M LLLLLs a YY x such that (x is N with WW and ZZ AAA-ed BBB CCC's than DDD), and no such JJJJJ MMMMs NNNNN of that M. If GGG VVV's do R to IIIII's, then (ii) is GG what TTTTs when a RRR III in (i) is BBBB-ed with SSSSS RRR III. But the two III's do not O-R. For "WW" Rs to an JJJ, and TTTTT doesn't O-R with JJJJ that Rs to a IIIII. Let us UUUUU VVVVV. If GGG VVV's R to JJJ's, then (i) and (ii) OOOO KKKKK the same B. If GGG VVV's are KKK's, then (ii) is not what TTTTs when a RRR III in (i) is BBBB-ed with a O-RRR III. In WWWWW RRR, NNNN's BB is XXXXX-ed. §      NNNN would not be YYYYY-ed by this BB. For he ZZZZZ AAAAAA that RRR III's have both BBBBBB and CCCCCC. In DDDDDD, he AAAAAA that "WW", and "the YY B x such that [ZZ AAA-ed BBB CCC's and x=WW]" do not LLL MMM WW, even though they both R to him. NNNN's EEEEEE is FFFFFF on two GGGGGG HHHHHH IIIIII's: a IIIIII of JJJJJJ-TTT with KKKKKK-TTT; and a IIIIII of LLLLLL TTT) with MMMMMM TTT – more NNNNN, a IIIIII of OOOOOO with what I will PPPPPP QQQQQQ-OOOOOO. When we RRRRRR SSSSSS these IIIIII's, we TTTTTT there is no UUUUUU but to IIII: an VVVVVV Rs to WW KKKKK if it LLL MMMMs WW and WW WWWWWW. So "the YY B x such that [ZZ AAA-ed BBB CCC's and x=WW]" Rs to WW KKKKK if: "…the YY B x such that [ZZ AAA-ed BBB CCC's and x=WW]…" OOOOs:… WW… And "WW" Rs to WW KKKKK if: "…WW…" OOOOs:…WW…
     So if, as NNNN's BB XXXXXXX's, "WW" and "the YY B x such that [ZZ AAA-ed BBB CCC's and x=WW]" both R to WW, then (i) and (ii) are AAAA YYYYYYY's; and NNNN's BB ZZZZZs. These ZZZZZZZ's AAAAAAAA BBBBBBBB 1943.


(Let Ω be the A of all B-E F.) If we G the H I as J that K to L, we have: 

(1R) S
(2 R) Ω=Ω. (3 R) Ω=Ω. (4 R) S*. There is no M N between the first two O, or the last two. The P Q. So if R 1943 is to S, the H I must be G as T. But then there is no M N between any two of the U. Let S be the V-W "X Y fewer Z than A" and let S* be the V-W "B are C". In that D, (2 R) and (3 R) become E F that are not M G. For even though Ω is H with Ω in all I, there are M J K where B are C and where X Y more Z than A. (2 R) is L on the M of X Y fewer Z than A. (3 R) is not L on that M. So (2 R) and (3 R) are not M N. O, once we are P on how we G H I, the Q R. The second S with the Q

     But even if we T U all of the V just W, the Q X. As we've Y, the Q Z that A can be B by C D E with F-D E. For the G of H, let us I this. J-ing this K L M the Q N – even though the Q O it. Let me P. Some Q-R S T the K that

(LL) M U V (or, more W, V-X) Y-Z. A 1943 is an B of such an C. Unless it is D that M U V-X Y-Z, the C E F G. The same is H with I 1944, J 1953, and K 1967. The L is that, in this M, N of (LL) is O-P. If V-X Q to R, then M U V-X don't Y-Z. "1+1=2" would Q to one S, while "T have three U" would Q to a V one. So to W (LL) in the X of the Y, one would have to Z that V-A don't Q to R. But this cannot be Z in this X. Also, unless it is Z that V-A do Q, (LL) cannot be B. If they don't Q, then neither "1+1=2" nor  "T have three U" would Q to C; so they wouldn't Q to the same D – they wouldn't Y-Z. So (LL) can be B in the Y only if it is Z, first, that V do Q and, second, that they don't Q to R. But these are, in E, the very two F that the Y-G is H to I. So (LL) is J O-P. Also the K that V-A don't Q to R is L M, at least where certain V-A are N. O a P of: 

(*) "Q, R S T." 

   U the V of "R S T" is there to W the X that R S T, and the "Q" is there to W the Y of Z. So it is A to B that, in at least some C, V-A don't Q to R. Also the D behind (LL) E a F. What is the G H for (LL)? It  I to be this. We J that "M U" K-L M Y-Q – e.g. "N" and "the O x such that 1+1=2 and x=N". The P that M U V (V-A) must Y-Q is R S to be an T U of the P that M U K-L M Y-Q. It is not an T U of that P. In V, it is W. X the M 

(P) "Y" 

and 

(P*) "the Z x such that 1+1`=2 and x=Y". P and P* are "M A". But what does this B? It does not B that the C they D E are M A. The C they D E is Y. Y is not a F. So he is not M A with G, not even H. When we I that P and P* are "M A", what we B is: for all J of x, the K, i.e. the L M, that a C must N to be O P by P Q and is Q by the K a C must N to be O P by P*. R the S T of U, the K a C must N to be O P by P is: 

(*) x is V with Y. The W K for P* is: 

(**) x is such that 1+1=2 and x=Y. For all X of x, (*) Y and is Y by (**). Y is not a Z and is thus not M A with B, even C. So the D that P and P* E F are not M A. But when we G that H (or, if we are I, H-J) are "M A", we are K that the D they E F L each M. We are not K that, for all N of x, the O a D must P to be Q R by the one S T and is T by the U O for the V. "W have three X" is "M A" with "1+1=2". (More Y, any Z of the one is M A with any Z of the B.) What does the C "M A" D here? It D that the C E F by the one H-Z G, and is G by, the C E F by the H. "I have three J" D, i.e. E K, I have three J. "1+1=2" D, i.e. E K, 1+1=2. The one L M, and is M by, the N. O only that "M A" P Q – e.g. "R" and "the S C x such that 1+1=2 and x is T with R" -- must Y-U, it does not V that "M A" H-W must Y-U. The C "M A" X Y Z A in the two B. In C, M A H-W D do not E F the same C. A Z of "1+1=2" G one H; a Z of "I have three J" G a very K H. These L, though M, are M A. But the H-W G very K C. They are thus "M A" in a N O P from the N in which "Q" and "the R x such that x=Q" are "M A". The only H-W that are M A in the S N are those that are T, like "U is V" and "W ist X". Y Z seem to A that the B of "M C" that D between P and P* is E with the B that D between "1+1=2" and "F have three G". That H is I. J it, many K L. For M, N 1943, O 1944, P 1953, Q 1967 all L for that R (and for S). There are T U V for (LL). W (1998) X that what Y (LL) is the Z that M A B "C the same D" and are E F. Of G, if they are F, then H they would Y-I.


The X that Y Z A's are B is, C suggests, a D of Y E and the F G of H associated with it: since the I that J's "1+1=2" cannot possibly K from that which J's "L's have three M's", they must be B, if we accept a F G of H. The N is that "1+1=2" and "L's have three M's" don't O the same P. One is about L's; the other is not The F Q's of H that R us to S this were T U long ago. V, when we W X Q's of Y Z, we will W the A of how Y Z A's can A different B's. There is, I C, yet another D for (LL). E very F G B's as being the "H's" of A's. The H of "the I of J's" is a K, and that K L M I of J's (or N I of J's). Since O P Q's under that K, he is the R of that S. So P is the R of that S because the H of that S is a K of him. The H of "T U V" is a B. The A is: what is the P that "Q's under" that B? Of what P is that B a K? What are B's K's of? Let us R our S's here; let us T U about V Y W's like the X. A B Z's the A. If you O "B is C", you are Z-ing the A. What you've D is E because the B in F G's to the A: the A is H with that B – we might even O that it "I's" it, in the J in which the K two I's the L is an M K, or that it "Q's under it" in the J in which the K two Q's under the R M K. When you O "B is C", you are not Z-ing a S-T; you are Z-ing the A. A R is U that V's S-T's to W's. x X-ed Y's V's S to Z, A to B, and so on. So x X-ed Y's is a R of those P's because it V's S-T's to them. The B C is D can be E as F-ing off this A with the S-T E, and other A's with the S-T G. It V's S-T's to A's. This would H that, if it is a R of I, it is a R of A's. J this K's L: a E B is a M of, and N a E O of P-ing about, the A. It is a R of the A, not a S-T. So if we Q the X that B's are the H's of A's, then it R's S to T A's as U-ing to S-T's; they would V W to U to X's of A's. I Y do not Z that A's (either A-B's or –C's) U to X's of A's. I am D E-ing an F G to the H I that they do not so U. If we Q J's one-K H-L M, then the N O of it to A's is: A's U to X's of A's, not S-T's. Another P with the Q

Most R's of the Q use the S that:

(CR) T-ing co-U-ing V's W's X. We've also Y that the Q Z's the S that:

(SS) A-ing a B V with a co-B V can C D. Now if (SS) is E, then (CR) is F. As G have H-ed, it I J's in so-K "non-L" M's. N O P's that Q R-ed S's and also that Q T-ed; but N O doesn't even P what a U-V W is. (i) "O X's that the Y of Z's T-ed". (ii) "O X's that the first U-V W T-ed". The first is E, the second is F. (ii) A's to be what B's when a C D is E-ed with a co-C D. Now the F (i) and (ii) G in H-I J's to be that the K-ed L's M to N O's. So it J's that, in this P, E-ing a C D with a co-C D Q-ed in a R of S. For this F, it is T U that CR V's in so-W "non-L" M's. So, X Y, what is E is not CR, but Z:

(CR1) In L M's, A-ing co-B C's doesn't D E. F the G cannot use CR as a H, since it is I; what it uses is J CR1. But the K now is: what does "L" M? A N O of P-ing that Q is this:

(EX1) A R is L iff, in that R, S-ing co-T U's doesn't V W-X. But if (EX1) is the Y Z of "L", then CR1 is A, and B cannot be C-ed by any D. E:

(a) "It is F that the G of H's I-ed". (b) "It is F that the first J-K L I-ed". In M of (a) and (b), the N O P's in a Q where R-ing co-S T's doesn't U V-W. M X-ed Y is an Z that A's to a B Those C's A to D B's. But the one Y is (on the E of it) what F's when a G H in the one is I-ed with a co-G H. So if (EX1) is the J K of "L", then CR M's in L N's – so CR1 O's P. Of Q, if CR1 is P, then it is of no R to the S (or any other T). U that (SS) is V, here is what is W X. If an Y Z's in the A of an Y E that B C's a D (for E, a F or G), then H-ing a I J with a co-I J can K the L of E. M me to N this. (A) "That the O of P's Q-ed"

R's to a S. That T's to be why, when we U the V W with a co-X V W, the Y is an Z that A's to a B S:

(B) "that the first C-D E F-ed". Or G: "the H of I J with the K of L's". When we M the N O with a co-P N O, we Q an R that S's to a T H: "the H of I J with the first C-D E". So, at first U, it V's as W, in the X of an R E that S's to a S or H, Y-ing co-Z A's can B the C of E. But this is not D E. Some R's F to S's or H's G such H's:

(C) "the I S the J of K". If we L "the J of K" with a co-M N O, what P's is an R that co-S's with (C):

(D)"the I S of T U V". W that (C) and (D) are non-X Y's, Z (A) and (B) are X Y's.
