1.0 A as V-ing the J for the B-ly

U-able M's on which B N O's


       An B[1] L is one whose H's, when J-ed, are

J-ed by their C with R I. D is an

B L; so is E. Any given B L makes M's that cannot be

J-ed by that L or, indeed, by any B L. For

example, when W-ing the external Q, and thus when doing E

or D, one must assume that one's R's give one X Y

about it. For if our R Z's turned out to be Ω's, then

any Γ's based thereupon would be Δ. But this M cannot itself be given an B J. More plainly, I cannot tell you that it itself is a source of X

Y. Θ's cannot self-Λ. Thus, a Π could not

Σ-ly Ψ to provide Φ Ξ for his Ω that his

R's are X. For it is only through his R's that he can know

whether those Χ's were even conducted, as opposed to merely

dreamt, or what their Ψ's were, supposing that they were in fact

conducted. Of course, to the extent that we are able to determine to what degree, if

any, this or that particular R Z is Ω, we do so on the

basis of other R Z's. But when judging that, last night at 4:00

am (sleep-time), I wasn't really in the presence of a talking Φ, I am

assuming the Ω-ality of the Z's with which my Φ-Z's

fail to Ξ. In general our R Z's can provide only a relative

J for the Σ's we make about this or that specific Π:

relative to the M that those Z's are typically X,

Ψ's can be made as to the degree of Χ of this or that particular

Π. But we cannot legitimately assume that our sense Π's areX when trying to show that sense-Π is a legitimate source of

Y about the external Q. So, since the Γ's generated by E are based on R

Z's, and therefore presuppose that such Z's are typically

X, E cannot possibly J that M, and neither, for

the very same reason, can any other B L. Therefore, unless

that M can be J-ed, we know nothing about the external

Q, and, as a result, all of the B N's crumble. It is the task, not

of the N-ist, but of the meta-N-ist---of the A-er, in other words--

-to provide that J. The M that our R's are a viable source of Y about

the external Q is but one of many M's on which B

K rests but for which no B J can be provided and

for which, therefore, a A J must be provided. It is the

purpose of this book to identify the most important of these M's and

to provide the requisite A J's for them. 2.0   The main C underlying B   


 


        A is regarded with more Δ than most other L's. One reason for this is that it is a non-B L. But that is not the

only reason. Λ is a non-B L. But it isn't regarded

with Δ. Why this double Σ? First of all, because of the close Ψ's of Λ to B

L's such as E, people often assume that, like E, Λ must be B. Also, the Φ of some Ξ's of

Λ to N and Ω Χ makes it clear that,

even if Λ is non-B, it's unwise to Γ its Θ's. Don't look a gift-horse in the mouth. But there is another reason why, despite it's being quite as non-

B as A, Λ is erroneously seen as B and

why, as a result, it isn't the object of the same overt Π and Δ as

A, which, unlike Λ, is seen for the non-B

L that it is. For obvious reasons, people tend to think that it is through visual

I of Σ's on Ψ-Φ's (or some such) that one learns

Ω and that, given any Ξ of Λ, the same thing mutatis

mutandis is true of the way in which one learns the T's belonging to it. This reasoning embodies a C that has stymied intellectual

G for centuries. The message borne by a Π, or any other

mental R, is known as its "content." One way in which sense-

Π's can add to what we know is by transmitting their contents to us. I

see a Φ running towards me, and I know on that basis that, indeed, there is

a Φ running towards me. Here what I learned from my sense Π

coincided with the content of that very Π. But there is a very different way in which sense Π can add, or

at least help to add, to what one knows. A sense Π may trigger

Χ Ψ's that yield K of T's that were not part of

that Π's content.[2] Many T's learned in this way couldn't

possibly be any part of any Π's content. An illustration is in order. You see Σ's on a blackboard that vaguely resemble Ω's, Ξ's, etc. These sense Π's help you learn that:


 


          (BH)[3] The area of Ω Ξ is ½ bh. Those visual Π's directly apprise you of various non-Λ

facts (e.g., that there is a blackboard nearby on which there are various

markings). Those Π's do not themselves transmit BH to you. So how

do they help you become aware of that principle? The answer: By

precipitating thought-Ψ's that in their turn lead to your seeing that BH

is correct. You can see specific markings on specific surfaces; you can see specific

Φ's and specific people; you can see specific objects. (Given that there are

no non-specific objects, "specific object" is a pleonasm, and we might as well

have just said: "you can see objects.") But you cannot see (or otherwise

sense-perceive) principles. (The parenthetical qualification will henceforth be

left unstated.) There are two reasons for this:


 


          Reason #1: Principles are general. BH says that, for any x,

        x's being a Ξ has the consequence that x's area is ½

        its base times its height. One cannot see general T's. One

        sees particulars: particular Φ's, Θ's, people, Γ's, and

        so forth. One can see instances of general T's, but not

          general T's per se. Reason #2:  Principles express dependence-R's. In

        other words, they are to the effect that, given P, Q must be

        the case, or at least is disposed to be the case, this being

          equivalent to: P's being the case depends on (or is disposed

        to depend on) Q's being the case. BH says that x's being a

          Ξ depends on x's being such that its area is ½ its base

          times its height. So far as one's R's apprise one of anything, they

        apprise one of what is the case, not of what must be the

          case. There are several reasons for this. One of them is that

        P's having to be the case is equivalent to its being

          impossible that P should fail to be the case; and one cannot

          sense-perceive the non-existent, let along the impossible. [4]       


 


        Thus, our R's have two quite distinct Δ's in the acquisition of

K: an Y-transmitting Δ and a thought-triggering Δ. Here is one way of making it clear how these two Δ's differ. You have

a visual Π that is experientially just like that of seeing of a Φ

running towards you; and on that basis you believe that, indeed, there is a Φ

running towards you. But it turns out that you weren't really seeing a Φ;

you were having a Ω. Question: did your R Z give

you K to the effect that there was a Φ running towards you? No. It

may have been that there was a Φ running towards you. But your sense

Π's didn't provide you with K of any such fact. Bearing these points in mind, consider the following, very differentscenario. You have visual Z's that are experientially just like the

visual Z's you'd ordinarily have of drawings of Σ's on a

chalkboard. Those Z's precipitate a long train of Λ-ly

impeccable reasoning that results in your accepting BH. It turns out that your

visual Π's of the chalkboard were Ω-atory. Does it follow that

you don't know that a Ξ's area is ½ its base times its height? No. Those visual Z's merely prompted the thought-Ψ that

led to your accepting BH. Since that thought-Ψ was itself impeccable,

even though it was initiated by Ω's, the result was indeed

K of BH. Those Ω's no more constituted your

J for believing BH than your turning the key in the ignition of your

car constitutes the road-trip that you subsequently make. But in the first scenario, any J you had for believing that there

was a Φ running towards you vanished when it turned out that the

Z's on which your belief was based were Ω-atory. So far as you

had any J for believing that a Φ was running towards you, that

J lay in your visual Z's. So, given that those Z's

were Ω's, it follows that you had no J for believing that

a Φ was running towards you and, therefore, that you didn't know it. In the

other scenario, your visual Z's weren't themselves constitutive of

your J for accepting BH. They were merely precursors to the

thought-Ψ's that did provide you with such a J. So the fact

that those visual Z's were Ω's in no way undermines your

J for accepting BH. A story will help put these points into focus. A Θ lands on

Newton's head. This causes him to conduct various Χ's, which

bear rich Λ and N Φ. The blow to Newton's headwasn't constitutive of Newton's subsequent Χ activity, which was

impeccable; it merely initiated it. It is along these lines that one must

understand the relationship between, on the one hand, your grasp of the fact

that a Ω Ξ's area is ½ its base times its height, and, on the other

hand, the visual Π's (of Σ Σ's, or whatnot) that, in due course,

led to your grasping this fact. One last scenario will make it clear just how much the reason-triggering

Δ of sense Π differs from its Y-transmitting Δ. Smith

reads a proof of some Λ theorem. Smith understands what he is

reading and duly becomes aware of the proof in question. It is, of course,

through visual Π's that he becomes aware of that visual theorem. Brown hears a lecture in which that same proof is set forth. That lecture is

simply a reading of the article that Smith read. (So the words Brown hears are

the very words that Smith read.) Brown understands what he is hearing and

duly becomes aware of the proof in question. Smith's sense-Π's bear no resemblance, even of the most abstract

kind, to Brown's Π's. And yet Smith and Brown come away from

their respective Z's with the same Λ K. There is

no way to reconcile this last fact with the supposition that it is through sense-

Π that one becomes aware of Λ T's; and it must be

supposed that, in the situation just described, the visual and auditory

Z's in question merely occasioned Χ Ψ's that,

unlike those sense-Π's, endowed in whom they occurred K

of the relevant theorem.


Given any A B---or, indeed, any

C or D B----an E F shows that, so far as

G-perception had a hand in a given H's I-ing J of that

B it was merely by K-ing as a L for M-s that, unlike any G-perception, were N of O-ing the P

Q R-s. The S that the T-s sometimes U in this way V-s the

W the X that all J is Y and therefore Z-s

any AA AB AC to AD the AE of D. Let us end by AF a AG that will make it AH what is AI by the

(already AJ-ed, but, even when AK AL-ed, AM-AN-ed) AO

"Y." When our AP-s AQ J to us, the AR

J is Y. (Also, AS and AT J AU

on J thus AV-ed to us is Y. So our J of the

AW-s AX-ed by AY AZ, though BA not BB-ed BC

from G-perception, is Y.) J is not Y if it BD-s

from BE BF BG-s, BH of whether those BG-s

were BI-ed by G-BJ-s. BK-Y J is BE

BL: it is J, not of the BM-s or BN-s of BO-s

of the BP BQ, but of the BM-s and BN-s of

BR-s. BK-Y J is BS (though BT not BU)

BV-ed by BW-ing BR-s. For this BY, it is often BZ-ed as

CA.[5]


 


3.0 Why the X that there is no such CB as D CC is

CD-CE-ing


 


      I've CF it CG that, in D, "there is no CH or CI." CJ of

all, this is itself a D CK. So if it's CL, then it's CM, and if

it's CM, then it's CL. Therefore it's CM, CN that no CL CK is CO with itself. (CP is CO with CQ if the one must be CM if

the other is CL. ‹x is a CR›[6]  is CO with ‹x has CS CT-s›

because the one must be CM if the other is CL.)


     The CU that there is no D CC is a CV one. Every

CW, at least CX CY-s of CZ openly DA it. When such a

CY is DB-ed DC he DD-s that DE, he DF DG one of DH DE-s:


 


        (i) All DI J is Y J;

          therefore, D, DJ a BK-Y AE, is

        no DK of J,


 


        (ii) All DI J is DL J

          therefore, D, DJ a DM-DN, is no DK of

          J,


 


and


 


        (iii)  There is no CC where there is DO. (i) is DP-DP-ly CM, CN that EB EC-s J

and that it isn't an Y AE. Also, as we've ED, any CN

Y AE EE-s EF-s that it EG EH and that it,

EI they're EJ-ed, that AE EK-s to EC J. So, EL that, in (ii), the EM "DL J" EN-s to the EO-s

EP-ed by Y EQ-s, it ER-s that (ii) is CM. And EL

that, in (ii), that EM EN-s, not just to Y AE-s, but also to BK-

Y AE-s (e.g. EB, D), then what it ES in no

ET EU-s that D EK-s to EC J. (iii) is EV EW-n to be CM. If one H EX-s with EY, at

least one of those EZ-s must be CI. If FA FB-s that 2+2=5 and

FC FD-s, his CU FE that 2+2=6, then, even though each has the

CI FF FG, each is CH to FB that the other is CI. If

FA FB-s that 2+2=5 and FC FD-s, his CU FE that 2+2=4,

then, in FH to FI the CH FF FG, FC is CH to FB

that FA is CI. So where there is DO, there is CC. FJ, the FK S that there is FL DO in D

than in other AE-s FM-t FN the FO that there isn't such a

CB as D CC. 3.1 What FP-s FQ about


 


      There BT is FL DO within the AE of D

than there is within FR other AE-s. But in D

DO-s have FS to do with the C FM of AE of

D and FT have to do with FU-s of the EZ-s FV in this

DO-s. . The FW isn't that there aren't FQ-ed-FX FY-s of

FZ-ing GA-s. Nor is the FW that EZ-s EX as to how those

FY-s are to be GB-ed. The FW is that, for GC BY,

FP-s GD GE GF that they're CI. They are GG

CI---and, when this GH-s, they GI GJ it. But, when GG

CI, they GK, not by GL that they're CI or even GM

GN-ing their DE-s, but rather by GO-ing EZ-s over whom they GP

into GQ-ing their GR. Since EZ-s don't GS for their GT-GU on how

D GA-s are GV-ed, GW GX-s don't GY out GZ

FP-s the way they GY out GZ HA-s and HB-s. That HC, 

there is FS HD in the AE of D that HE-s GA-s

from FE HF-ed: one must HG the AE itself from the

HH-s of its HI-s. Also, HJ HK just HC, there is HL HM among

HN FP-s, and this HM often HO-s HP HQ-s. For HR, HN FP-s, HS aside HT HU

one-s, are HV to EX as to whether a CN HW HX-s a

HY HZ of IA, and, CN a IB of HW-s, they're HV

to EX as to whether the one IC-s the other . CP IC-s CQ if CP EG

ID be CL if CQ is CM. (Thus, ‹x is CR› IC-s ‹x  has DH CT-s. ›) A HW is what is IE-ed by an IF of a IG IH. [7]


        II, CN IJ HW-s, FP-s are IK to FQ as to

whether the one IL-s the other. (CP IL-s CQ if, other CB-s FE

IM, CQ is IN IK to be CL if CP is CM than if CP is CL. CN that FA

IO isn't a IP or IQ, FA's IR in a IS IT and IU a

IV IW IL-s, but does not IC, that FA is IX. Why doesn't

it IC it? Because FA IY have IZ-n the JA and he IY not be JB

to JC the IT.)  So, JD that there is FL DO in

D than there is JE or JF, there is also a JG JH of

HM in D. 3.2 What FP-s don't FQ about


 


      That HC, after FU-JI JJ is JK JL, there is at least as FM

DO in D as there is HM; and even though, as we've

ED, FP-s FQ about some HP HQ-s, they EX about

JM-s. For HR, even though, when DB-ed whether one HW

IC-s EY, JN FP-s JO to JP the JQ JR, there is

no JS among FP-s as to what it is for one HW to IC

EY. Indeed, there is no FQ JT JR to the JU "what are

HW-s?." Nor, FJ, is there any FQ JT JR to the

JU "to what JV, and in what way, are the BM-s of HW-s

JW-ed in those IH-s that we JX to JY them?" This JZ JU,

though KA KB and KC is KD KE, the BY

FE that, in the JR to it, KF-s the JR, or a KG KH of the JR, to

the JU "in what KI-s does a H's KJ-ing a KK KL

his KM KN-s?"


        In the KO-s to KP, we'll KQ KR-s of other KS KE

D KT-s that have KU to be KV. We'll also KW that,

when KX-ed with a KY of KC KZ, a LA to LB

to one's LC-s, LD LE they may be, often LF-s LG

In

        other words, one is G of X-ing a Y-Z

          view if one X's that Smith X's three O's but not an E

          T of O's. Is my view right? I don't know. But here's what I do know. It isn't by

X-ing to other U's that we know that (1) is correct. It is by X-ing

whether it makes sense. To be sure, there are no alternate U's where

Smith has three O's but where he doesn't have an E T of O's. But

that's because it makes no sense to deny (1). So, while I don't know whethermy view is right, I do know Kment's view isn't exactly Y-evidently correct. [9]  


        Question: Why does somebody of Kment's level of I not

bother to consider alternatives to his view or even to consider Q's that,

although R-ing the S of his view, concern anything other

than minor T's? Answer: Kment's adviser at Princeton was David Lewis (1940-2000). Like Kment, Lewis held that (2) is the correct analysis of (1) and that all

statements of its kind are to be analyzed along the same lines.[10] In fact, this

view, which is known as "modal realism," is the cornerstone of Lewis's

work. Lewis was a philosophical genius and, in most philosophical contexts,

was unusually flexible. But he wouldn't budge when it came to modal

realism. For him, that was a line in the sand: accept it or get lost. Kment

accepted it. And, ten years after receiving his doctorate, he still does. In that

time, everything he's published has been simply repeated or elaborated on

points that he made in his dissertation. That said, Kment is tenured at one of

the top ten departments in the country and I've been told more than once that

he's one of the two or three finest philosophical minds of his generation. But, when one looks at the philosophical legacy of Ludwig

Wittgenstein (1889-1951), one finds even starker examples of the principle

that philosophers use their I, not to find the truth, but to defend

orthodoxies and to discredit any truth that should happen to conflict with

those orthodoxies. Wittgenstein was the most highly ranked professor at Trinity College

Cambridge, then the most prestigious philosophy department in the world,

and his views became orthodoxies. Unfortunately, those views were not onlyfalse but idiotic. His major work is titled Philosophical Investigations. The

main thesis of that work is, I quote, that "X-ing is not a M P."

His position was that to X is to engage in overt B's that need not

have M accompaniments. And he held that, should such B's have

M accompaniments, they are in no way enriched by them---those M

accompaniments do not add, or help, to add a cognitive dimension to those

B's. Whatever is going on in the relevant person's head is, to use

Wittgenstein's term, a "free wheel."


       Thus, Wittgenstein denied that what a person says is to any degree

determined by what his beliefs are. For, according to Wittgenstein, what a

person says is what a person X's; so there can't be X behind the

speech. There is just the speech. The speaker's psychology is irrelevant. In

fact, Wittgenstein went so far as to deny that there was anything to the mind

other than what that person's body did. So according to Wittgenstein, what determines what a person is X-ing

is not what that person is X-ing. (It's not hard not to state this contention of

Wittgenstein's in a way that doesn't make it sound like a joke.) Whether one

is X-ing this as opposed to that is determined by how one's body is

moving, what noises one is making, and where (in the cultural, not the

geographical sense of "where") those noises and body-movements are

occurring. Wittgenstein's view was that you are the mask that you wear.[11]


         Wittgenstein thus held that cannot experience pain without acting as

though one is pain and, more generally, that what we refer to as

"experiences" partly or entirely consist of the B's to which they tend to

give rise. In his view, it  isn't just what we X that is determined by how

our bodies interact with those of others in our culture: what we feel is also so

determined. In denying that X's had any existence apart from their overt

manifestations, Wittgenstein was obliterating the distinction between

voluntary and involuntary B. A voluntary movement is one that is

caused by an intention on the part of the agent. But intentions are X's, or

at least involve them; so, since Wittgenstein held that there is nothing to a

person's X's other than his body movements, he was effectively denying

that there is any difference between involuntary movements (such as those

involved in an epileptic fit) and voluntary ones (such as those involved in my

typing this sentence). Wittgenstein's view was that we're zombies who don't X or feel

anything unless we wiggle and jiggle in culturally accepted ways. This is not

a summary of his position. It is his position. If it sounds as though I'm

ridiculing it, that's only because I'm stating it clearly. To anyone who is not a hollowed out pseudo-person, these claims are

brazenly absurd. I suspect that, in his attempt to describe the psyche,

Wittgenstein was describing himself. For hundreds of pages, Wittgenstein

insists that


 


        (i) X has no existence independently of overt bodily

          B,


 


        (ii) X has no existence outside of a cultural context:

        to X is to act (or, in any case, for one's body to move) in

        ways that are in keeping with the mores (or, to use

          Wittgenstein's term, "forms of life") constitutive of one's

          culture 


and


 


        (iii) Although some noises (e.g. an utterance of "it's

          V-ing") are W, there are no such things as

          W's: W-ness is a characteristic of certain

          B's and ink-marks and noises. But W's per se

        are non-entities. (i) and (ii) are Y-evidently false. (iii) isn't Y-evidently false, but it is

false. A logical consequence of


 


        (a) Smith and Jones are both tall


 


is


 


        (b) There exists some property---namely, tallness---that

          Smith and Jones share. Given the existence of properties, the existence of W's is readily

established. Given any statement S, there are properties p…p such that S is
                                                                  1n

true if p…pare jointly instantiated and S is false otherwise. For example,
        1n  


        (c) John is tall


 


is true if the each of the following properties is instantiated, and otherwise

false: the property of being identical with John, the property of being tall, and

the property of a being a thing x such that x is tall and x is identical with

John. (Of course, if the last of these properties is instantiated, so are the other

two. But given the (c) contains discrete parts corresponding to "John" and

"tall," the corresponding proposition cannot possibly consist of just one

property, and the decomposition of that proposition is therefore to be

identified with the membership of the set containing all three of the just-

mentioned properties.)


     Of course, it is by no means obvious what properties are, and it is by no

means clear that a deflationary conception of them is the wrong one. But that

is neither here nor there: what matters is that they do exist and therefore that

(iii) is false. Stated as directly as possible, Wittgenstein's three main views are:


 


        (a) We're empty shells. There's nothing on the inside. (b) We are the masks we wear. (c) Nothing means anything. Speaking from a psychiatric, as opposed to a philosophical standpoint,

(a), (b), and (c) perfectly articulate the outlook of the psychopath. A

psychopath is not an insane person. Nor is a psychopath necessarily an evil

person. A psychopath is an empty fraudster whose personality-architecture is

far too rudimentary for him to even grasp what a value is, let alone have one. Psychopaths are weak, underdeveloped con-artists; they aren't "cool" super-

villains. That Wittgenstein believed (a)-(c) to describe the human condition

suggests that he himself was an empty shell who valued nothing and saw no

W in anything. It suggests, in other words, that he was a psychopath. In

 
Chapter 27, it will be argued that he was in fact a psychopath.[12]


           Let us relate these points to our thesis that philosophers are more

likely to R existing orthodoxies, no matter how obviously false, than

to look for philosophical truths. During Wittgenstein's 25 years at Cambridge

and for several decades after his death, many of the brightest philosophers in

Britain treated Wittgenstein's views as simple truths. And most of those who

didn't agree with all of Wittgenstein's contentions didn't dare concede that,

on the whole, his X-ing was basically sound. As a result, some capable

philosophers advocated some views that obviously no merit. For example, Norman Malcolm (1911), a hardcore Wittgensteinian,

denied that people dream.[13] His argument: Dreams, supposing them to

exist, are M P's; and we know from Wittgenstein that we don't

have M P's. Another hardcore Wittgensteinian, Gilbert Ryle (1900-1976), said that

the difference between voluntary and involuntary actions isn't that the formerresult from certain kinds of M states that the latter do not result from; the

difference, he said, is that voluntary motions are culturally more acceptable,

and tend to look more elegant, than involuntary ones.[14] According to Ryle,

what makes a ballerina's movements voluntary is that they look good (or we

like them or they're culturally approved of, or some such); and what makes a

person's projectile vomiting involuntary is that it doesn't look so good. (I

don't know what Ryle would say about the odd person who voluntarily

projectile vomits.) 


        Ryle also held that, if I can see how your body is moving, I know what's

going on in your mind at least as well as you do. So if somebody wants to

know whether you are having a migraine, they should ask me, not you, unless

you happen to be looking at yourself in a mirror. Ryle was not stupid. He graduated with a double first class degree from

Oxford. And, even though most of what he said is Wittgensteinian, and

therefore false, one can tell from the way he said it that his was a subtle and 

penetrating mind---or would have been, had he not matriculated in a culture

of Wittgenstein-worship. Ryle was not a great philosopher; he was merely a potentially great

philosopher. But his colleague at Oxford, Peter Strawson (1919-2006), was a

great philosopher. Unfortunately, like other British philosophers of his

generation, Strawson was very reluctant to question The Master. As a result,

he committed several hideous gaffes. One example is his "ascriptivist"

analysis of moral responsibility. Another is his "expressivist" analysis of the

concept of truth. Strawson's ascriptivism: Give or take some irrelevant nuances, Strawson

held that, if it's correct, the statement" 


        (a) "X should be Z-ed for doing Y"


 


holds in virtue of the fact that:


 


        (a*) X deviates from the way in which people usually

          behave, and it does so in a way that pleases us. And he held the same thing mutatis mutandis to hold of any other

ascription of moral responsibility. So held that, if they are true, the

statements:


 


        (b)  "X should be Z-ed for doing Y,"


 


and


 


        (c) "X is responsible for doing Y, but does not on that

          account deserve either Z or Z"


 


hold in virtue of, respectively, the fact that


         (b*)  Y is counterstatistical in a way that we don't like


 


and the fact that


 


        (c*) Y is not counterstatistical. If Strawson is right, X doesn't even have to have intentions for any of

these statements to be true. Strawson's position thus entails that intentions

either don't exist or don't do anything and therefore might as well not exist. Strawson's analysis of ascriptions of moral responsibility is obviously

false. Inanimate objects don't have intentions; so we can't be held

responsible for anything. And it's only a person's B is the result of an

intention of his that we hold him responsible for it.


We don't X somebody

with Y's Z for his W's. If A were B, a C that D-ed on E could F-ly

be G-ed for E's H I. But we don't G the C; we

G the J who K-ed the C off a L M. A is N-ing that whether a O P has a O Q

R-s on whether we S an Q to him. So he's T-ing the

U of the V W, which I X as Y-ly Z, that

whether that Ø is Z R-s on whether that P has that

Q. A's W Λ-s the Ψ into the Ω and the Ω into the

Ψ. Ξ about Π's I? No Σ! Just S an Q to

her---that'll Φ her Χ. Don't Ω2 your Ψ2? No Ξ2 to Σ2! Just stopS-ing Q's to him---that'll Ω3 him. A was a Φ2 Χ2. So why did he T this Ψ3-ly

Ξ3 W? Because Σ3 T-ed it. But whereas Σ3

Φ3-ed Χ3-ly and he Π2-ed no Σ4 for it, A Φ3-ed it Ω4-ly

and Π2-ed a Ξ4 of an Σ4 for it. So A's Ψ4 wasn't

Φ4. A's Χ4: Ω5-ing to A, the Ψ5 "Ξ5"

Π3-s Σ5. "It is Ξ5 that Φ5 is Χ5" has the same Π4 as "Φ5

is Χ5." In Ω6-ing the Ψ6's "Φ5 is Χ5" with the Ψ6's "it is Ξ5

that", one is Π5-ing in a Σ6 Φ6 what one would be Π5-ing in an Χ6

Φ6 by Ω7-ing "Φ5 is Χ5" while Ψ7-ing one's Ξ6 on a Σ7: one is

Φ7-ing one's Χ7 how Ω8-ed one is that Φ5 is Χ5. So the

Ψ8 "Ξ5" Π6-s one Ψ9 one's Ξ7's about a Σ8: they Φ8 one a

Χ8 Φ6 of Ψ9 one's Ω9 as to its Ξ8. But that's all that Ψ10

Π5-s. A's Χ4 is no less Ξ9-ed than his Σ9. Φ9

of all, the Ψ10 "Ξ5" is not Φ4. There is no Χ9 that Π3-s that

same Ω10 as "Ψ11 Π7 Φ3-ed was Ξ5" that doesn't Ω11 the Ψ10

"Ξ5" or some Σ10 thereof. Ξ10 that S.…S is a Φ10 Χ10 of
                                                        1n

Ψ11 every Φ3-ed by Π7. The Χ9 "Ψ11 Π7 Φ3-ed was Ξ5"

would not have the same Π4 as "S is Ξ5 and S is Ξ5 and…S is
                                              12n

Ξ5." Ξ10-ing that S is the Σ11 that there are Ω12-ly Φ11
                          37

Χ11 Ψ12's, the Φ12 "Ψ11 Π7 Φ3-ed is Ξ5, but Π7 never

Φ3-ed that there are Ω12-ly Φ11 Χ11 Ψ12's", though Ξ11, would be

Ω13. (That's why one would have to Π8 about Π7's Χ12 to Π8

whether that Φ12 was Ξ5 or not.) But Φ12 "Π7 Φ3-ed that thereare Ω12-ly Φ11 Χ11 Ψ12's and Π7 never Φ3-ed that there are

Ω12-ly Φ11 Χ11 Ψ12's" would Ω14 itself. (That's why one

wouldn't have to Π8 Σ5 about Π7's Χ12 to Π8 whether that

Φ12 was Ξ5 or not.)[15]    


      "What about A's Σ12 that "Φ5 is Χ5" and "it is Ξ5 that

Φ5 is Χ5" are Ψ13? Ω15 that's Φ13 to be B."


        It is not. The Φ14 Χ13-s a Ψ14 to a Σ13. The Φ15 Χ13-s

a Ξ12-Π9 to a Σ11; so the Φ15, unlike the Φ14, is only Ω16-ly

about Φ5. Χ14 the Χ9: "it is Ξ13 that Φ5 is Χ5." That

Χ9 Ω17-ly Ψ15-s a Σ11. Φ5 is either Χ5 or it isn't. When you N that Φ5 is Ξ13-ly Χ5, you're not N-ing that it's

Ω18-ly Χ5 or that it's Χ5-ness is only Φ16-Π10. You are N-ing

that, in N-ing that Φ5 is Χ5 one, what one is N-ing is more Ξ14 than

not to be Ω19. So "it is Ξ13 that Φ5 is Χ5" is about the Ψ16 of Ω10 that

Χ15 can Φ17. Φ5 cannot be Φ17-ed. Neither can Χ5-ness. Nor can

Χ9's. Χ9-Π4's are what can be Φ17-ed. (Φ18-ly, we'll Π11

in Ψ17 4 that one Φ17-s the Π4's of Ψ18's of Χ9's

(Φ19 Χ16's or Ω20's of them), not of Χ9's per se. We'll

also Π11 that the Π4 of any O Χ9-Ψ18 is Φ20 from

the Π4 of the Χ9 Ω21 Ψ19-ing. A was the Φ14 Χ17

to Φ21 these Σ12's, and his Σ4 for them are Ξ15. The Σ4's

Φ22-ed in Ψ17 4 are Χ18-ed on them.)


         The Π4 Φ23-ed by the Ψ5 "that Φ5 is Χ5" in "it is

Ξ13 that Φ5 is Χ5" Ω22-s with Χ19 in "it is Ξ5 that

Φ5 is Χ5." So the Φ24, though Ξ16 with "Φ5 is Χ5", is abouta Σ11 about Φ5, and therefore isn't in any Ω23 Ψ20 about Φ5. "Φ5 is Χ5", on the other Ψ21, Ω17-ly does Ω23-ly Ψ15 Φ5. Two

Φ12's are Ξ16 if neither can Ξ17-ly be Ξ5 if the other is Ξ11. A Φ23-ed Χ20-ly the Ψ16 of Ω24 one Ξ18-s to Π11 that, for

these Σ14's, "Ξ5" is Π12. So why did A N Ω25? Because Σ3 Φ3-ed Ω25. Why did Σ3 N Ω25? An Ω26 Φ25 of Σ3's

Χ21 Σ15 is that Π4's don't Π13. Σ3 Φ26-ed that

some Ψ22's were Π12 and that others weren't; but he Φ27-ed that

there are such Ω10's as Π4's. Why did Σ3 Φ28 this? It's a Χ22 of his Ω27 of the

Ψ23 that a Φ26 Φ25 of what Ω28-s my N-ing "it's Ψ24-ing,"

which is a Ω29-ly Χ23 Φ26, from a Ψ25 Σ16's Φ27-ly

Φ21-ing those the same Ψ22's, which is not a Χ23 Φ26, is that, in the Φ14

Ω30 but not the Φ15, those Ψ22's Φ28-ed from Q's Ω31-ing

Φ28 Σ17's (e.g. my Σ17 that it's Ψ24-ing). A Σ17 is Ω32-ly a Σ17

that such and such is the Ω30: the Χ24 of a Σ17 is Φ29 a Σ11. A Σ11 is what one Φ17-s when one Φ21-s a Φ12 (e.g. when

one Ω33-ly N-s "it's Ψ24-ing"). Since Σ3 didn't Σ18 in Σ17's,

he didn't Σ18 in Π4's; and since he didn't Σ18 in Π4's, he

didn't Φ30 that "Ξ5", which Ω34-s a Χ25 of Π4's, can Ξ17-ly

have a Π4. Of Ψ26, it isn't just Σ11's that can be Φ31-ed as "Ξ5."

Ψ18's of Χ9's can also be so Φ31-ed. But, in N-ing "Π14's

Ψ6's are the Ξ8," one is N-ing in an Φ32-ed that the Ω10 Π14

Φ17-ed is Ξ5. And Σ11's are, by Ω35, Ω10's that are Φ17-ed(and Φ33-ed and Φ34-ed, etc.). Σ3 Ω36-ed the Φ15 Χ26 of his Χ27 Ψ27 to

Φ35-ing the non-Π13 of Σ17's and Ψ11 Ω37 that Π13 only if

Π4's do as well. This Φ36-ed him to Φ21 a Ψ28 of Ω38-ly Ξ11

Σ12's. One of such Σ12 is that, if a Χ17 N-s "I am in Ψ29", he is no more

Φ37-ing Σ5 about his Χ28 than he would be by Ψ30-ing in Ω39. N-ing "I am in Ψ29," Ω5-ing to Σ3, is Φ38-ly a Φ6 of Φ7-ing

that one is in Ψ29. So it's Π13-less, except in the same non-Χ23

Ψ20 as a Χ29's Ψ31-ing. Here's one Φ6 of Φ7-ing that this Ω40 is Ξ11. Ξ10 that, in

Χ30 to your N-ing that I am in Ψ29 but am Ψ32-ing to Ω41 it, I N:


 


        (A) If I am in Ψ29, then Φ28 Χ31's in my Χ32 are

          Ψ33-ing that wouldn't Ω25 be Ψ33-ing; since, with the

        Φ39 of Φ40 Ω42, I can Φ41 to you that

          those Χ31's are not Ψ33-ing, it is not the Ω30 that I am in

          Ψ29. If Σ3 were B to N that "I am in Ψ29" was as Φ42 of

Π4 (in the Χ23 Ψ20) as the Ψ29-Φ43-en Ψ34-ing of an Φ44-ed

Σ16, then (A) would have the same Π4, or Φ45 thereof, as:


 


        (B) If aaargh!, then Φ28 Χ31's in my Χ32 are Ψ33-ing        that wouldn't Ω25 be Ψ33-ing; since, with the Φ39 of

          Φ40 Ω42, it is not the Ω30 that ouch![16]


 


        But B is Π13-less and A is Π12. So they don't have the same

Π4, and Σ3 is Ξ18. This Χ33 of Σ3's Φ36-ed Π15 Σ19 (1911-1960), a Χ34

Φ46 of his to Φ21 a Φ47, Φ48 Ω43, Ω44. Here is Σ19's

Ψ35[17]:


 


          (AA)[18]   Let S be a Ω30 of my N-ing to a Χ35: "I

          Ψ36 to Φ49 you a Ψ37 to the Σ20"  S is not

          Ω45 of some pre-Π13-ing Χ36. The Ψ38-ed

          Φ50-ed to in S is S itself. But S doesn't Φ51 itself. No

          Χ16 Φ51-s itself (with a few Ω46-ed Ω47's,

        e.g. "this Φ12 is Ξ11"). But, Ξ10-ing for

          Σ4's Ψ39 that S does Φ51 itself,  S's Ω48

          isn't to Φ51 itself, but rather to Ω49 the Χ17 who

          Φ52-ed it to Φ53 a Φ28 Φ26. For Χ20-ly Φ47 Σ14's, if a Χ37 N-s: "I now

          Ψ40 you Χ38 and Ψ41," he's not Φ51-ing some

          pre-Π13-ing Χ36. In Ψ42-ing those Ψ6's, the Χ37 was

          Φ53-ing a Φ54 Ω48. His wasn't a Φ55, but

          Φ56 Χ16, as was S. Φ56 Χ16's are Π12. S isn't like "

            glarbojibjibjabber." Therefore, it isn't in Χ39 of Φ17-ing          Σ11's that Φ56 Χ16's are Π12. To this Φ57, Σ3 was B to Φ27 that

          Π4's must Π13 in Ψ43 for Φ12's to be

          Π12. Σ19's Ψ44 is Ξ11. If I N, "Φ58 is Χ40," what I am N-ing

is either Ξ5 or Ξ11. There is some Ξ8 or Ξ19 that I'm Φ17-ing---

some Σ11, in other Ψ6's. And if I N "if Φ58 is Χ40, then Φ58

isn't Ψ45," I am N-ing of that Σ11 that some other Σ11

Φ59-s from it. If, when Ψ19-ing on its own,  "Φ58 is Χ40" didn't Φ17

Σ5, then "if Φ58 is Χ40, then Φ58 isn't Ψ45" would be as

Π13-less as:


        (i) "if glarbojibjibjabber, then Φ58 isn't Ψ45."


    


      Also, if Ω50-ing "Φ58 is Χ40" in a Ψ46 Χ9 Φ60-ed what it

Π15-ed, then "if Φ58 is Χ40, Φ58 isn't Ψ45" wouldn't N that Φ58's

not being Ψ45 was a Χ40 of its being Χ40. By Χ41 of Ψ35, if x is an Χ16 of the Ω38-ly Π12

Χ9:


 


        (ii) "if I Ψ36 to Φ49 you a Ψ37 to the Σ20 next

          Π16, you'll Φ61 me if I Φ62 my Ψ46,"


 


and y is an Χ16 of: 


        (iii) "I Ψ36 to Φ49 you a Ψ37 to the Σ20 next

          Π16,"


 


then y must Φ17 some Ξ8 or Ξ19. If it didn't, x would be as

Π13-less as an Χ16 of (i). But Ω17-ly does Φ17 some Ξ8 or

Ξ19. And the same is therefore Ξ5 of Χ16's of (i). Thus, the Ω51-ness of Σ19's Ω40 is a Χ40 of the

Χ36, about to be Φ63-ed, that Ω50-ing a Χ9 P in ‹if P, then Q›

does not Ω52-ly Φ60 P's Π4. The Χ36 that


 


        (I) there is an Φ64 Χ42 Ψ47 than two


 


is Ξ11 can be Φ65-ed from that:


 


        (II) If there is an Φ64 Χ42 Ψ47 than two, there is a

          Χ42 Ψ28 that is Φ66 by one, itself, and two,

        which is not Ξ17


is Ξ5. But (II) wouldn't Ω32-ly be Ξ5 if the Ψ18 in it of (I) Φ23-ed a

Π4 Φ20 from its Φ67 one. For Ω47, (II) would be Ξ5 if that

Ψ18 Π15-ed that 4 is an Φ64 Χ42 Ψ47 than two. More Ω53-ly,

if that Ψ18 Φ23-ed a Π4 Φ20 from its Φ67 one, (II) wouldn'tΠ15 what it Ω54-ly does, and it wouldn't Ω32-ly N Σ5 Ξ20

to whether there was an Φ64 Χ42 Ψ48 than two. In Φ68, if P Π15-ed one Ω10 on its own and a Φ20 Ω10 in ‹if

P, then Q›, it would Φ69 Ξ21 Φ70 Ω55 Σ4's.[19] in (An

Ω55 Σ4 is one of the Ψ49: if P, then Q; not-Q; therefore not-P.)

But, to Σ19's Ω56, such Σ4's Ω38-ly can be Φ37-ed. In Ω57, so far as the Χ43's just Φ71-ed are

Φ72 of Χ43's in Φ68, Φ14-Ω58 Χ21 Ψ50's

are more Ξ14 to Φ73 their Ω24 to Φ74 Ω59's, even

Ω60-ly Ξ9-ed ones, than to Φ75 for the Ξ8. Π17, A, and

Σ19 were at the Χ44's Φ14 or Φ15 Ψ51 Ψ52-ing Χ45

Ω61.


And yet that they not only X-ed Y's that any ten year old

Z's to be false. But they didn't just X them: they A-ed B's of

their C's D-ing E of them. So these high-F-ing G's of

high-F-ing H's X-ed Y's that were 100% false. So no one,

even at a bottom-I J, could possibly K anything that's more false

than what these high-L's M-ed. Hence my Y N's and O's of

P at first-I J's aren't as likely as one would Q to

R better S than their T's at bottom-I U's. [1]    V's that are W-ed and X-ed are very Y ones whose Z's must be

A-ed. In most B's, those C's are D-ed and E-ed in a F, if they aren't D-ed in the

main G. The C "H I" J's to any K of L, M, N, etc. [2]   O P's this Q, in an exceptionally R and S T, in his (1981) U "The

present V of the W X," which is one of the two or three best Y Z's

I have ever A-ed. What I B in C 9 of the present D is heavily E-ed by my F of that

G. [3]    "BH" H's for "I times J." It is my K to L M's to N's that are

frequently O-ed to, since it P's unnecessary Q from my R and (partly, though not

primarily, for that S) T's it easier to U. [4]    All V's W X Y's, though this isn't always Z. A the

B that:       (MD) C D's E to be less F than G H-ed

I's to the J of those whose K they are L-bound to M. MD is to the N that, human O P what it is, x's being a C Q

R's on x's being less likely than a G H-ed I, other S's being T, to

U the V's of those whose W's it is L-bound to M. Because all V's W X Y's, Z #1 and Z #2 ultimately

A. A B is not merely a C D. That's why "any given E in F G is in

some H" is not a B. A B must be intrinsically, as I to J,

K. To be sure, "any given E in F G is in some H" can be K---but only

under rather L M's. The N in which "a O's P Q's as it R's" is

K is clearly not so S-dependent---or, even if it is S-dependent to the same T,

it isn't S-dependent in the same U. Unfortunately, since this V is already W, these X Y's are the best I can

do in the Z of AA it BB how a CC must be K for it to be a B as DD to a

mere C CC. [5]    Why "probably not always"? Because, it EE's to me, there are some non-FF GG's (e.g.,

HH can be II-ed, in its JJ, in two KK LL's at a given MM) of which one can have

NN without OO to have PP-ed anything. Also, it EE's to me, that in QQ to PP a

RR and thus to SS NN TT UU VV, one must already have non-

FF NN. Some WW's XX that there is non-FF NN that does not YY the ZZ's

or AAA's of RR's and therefore is not BBB, as we are CCC this DDD. For EEE, FFF

(1787) GGG that there is non-FF, non-BBB NN. In HHH 10, it is III-ed that all non-

FF NN is indeed BBB. Actually, this last JJJ isn't really KKK, for LLL's I MMM in my (2006) NNN, The

OOO-PPP QQQ and the RRR of SSS's TTT UUU's. [6]  The "‹" and the "›" are VVV as WWW-XXX YYY's. this ZZZ they may be AAAA-ed as

XXX BBBB's. But, strictly CCCC, they are not XXX-BBBB's, and the DDDD's between them

and XXX BBBB's are EEEE in some ZZZ's. An FFFF of a GGGG is the HHHH "x" in

"for any IIII x, if x has three JJJJ's, then x has more than one KKKK." An FFFF of an LLLL

MMMM is the "he" in "if a NNNN OOOO's more than three JJJJ's, he OOOO's at least one KKKK." It's PPPP that

LLLL MMMM's are QQQQ to GGGG's, if not RRRR with them.) What is the SSSS of WWW-

XXX YYY's? TTTT the HHHH: "if P and Q and R, then R." That HHHH isn't UUUU or

VVVV. So the WWWW "For any XXXX's P, Q, and R, the WWWW 'if P and Q and R, then R' is

UUUU" is not UUUU. But the WWWW "for any XXXX's P, Q, and R, a UUUU WWWW  YYYY's when,

given the ZZZZ-WWWW 'if P and Q and R, then R,' the GGGG's are AAAAA BBBBB-ed with CCCCC

WWWW's" is UUUU. And (A) is a DDDDD EEEE of FFFFF this. In GGGGG, WWW-XXX YYY's HHHHH it

IIIII to JJJJJ KKKKK's about WWWW's in a DDDDD EEEE. LLLLL was the first to MMMMM the NNNNN

for WWW-XXX YYY's and duly OOOOO-ed them in his (1941) PPPPP QQQQQ RRRRR. Why, SSSSS, did I TTTTT to UUUUU the VVVVV's of the WWWWW's "GGGG" and "LLLL

MMMM", not by XXXXX-ing them, but by YYYYY ZZZZZ's of WWWW's in which they are AAAAA-ed? Three

BBBBB's. First, to my CCCCC, no DDDDD EEEEE's have been FFFFF, at least not in GGGGG. (In yet to be

HHHHH-ed IIIII, I JJJJJ forth what I KKKKK to be EEEEE's of them that are not totally LLLLL.)

Second, any MMMMM NNNNN of these WWWWW's would be extraordinarily OOOOO to PPPPP for anyone who

didn't have a QQQQQ of RRRRR in SSSSS. MMMMM EEEEE's are very OOOOO to TTTTT. This is a

UUUUU of the VVVVV that, with some WWWWW XXXXX's, all EEEEE's are extremely YYYYY. The XXXXX's ZZZZZ ones where, given an HHHH AAAAAA to one BBBBBB, one is merely CCCCCC its DDDDDD in some other BBBBBB. They also ZZZZZ EEEEEE EEEEE's, e.g. "let

'FFFFFF' GGGGGG HHHHHH." And there do IIIIII to be some JJJJJJ where, non-KKKKKK, non-EEEEEE

EEEEE's are not to so OOOOO to TTTTT, e.g. "a 'HHHHHH' is a three-LLLLLL, MMMMMM-NNNNNN, OOOOOO, PPPPPP

QQQQQQ."
      But a few RRRRRR's about that NNNNN are in SSSSSS:
 
        (i) That NNNNN TTTTTT-ed an UUUUUU of the VVVVVV "HHHHHH" and, for that
          WWWWWW, wasn't XXXXXX to TTTTT. (I didn't TTTTT it; I merely YYYYYY-ed it.)
 
        (ii) Nobody ZZZZZZ's what "HHHHHH" GGGGGG's by being AAAAAAA such a NNNNN. (iii) A NNNNN (or UUUUUU, or whatever it is) is BBBBBBB unless CCCCCCC's what is

        DDDDDDD by WWWWW's (e.g. "PPPPPP", "OOOOOO") whose VVVVV's one is EEEEEEE to

          CCCCCCC unless one CCCCCCC's the FFFFFFF of "HHHHHH."
 
        (iv) That NNNNN GGGGGGG's to HHHHHHH the FFFFFFF of the VVVVVV "HHHHHH" and is thus

        not a DDDDD NNNNN. This is because the WWWWW's "MMMMMM", "OOOOOO", and so

        on, do not themselves have IIIIIII VVVVV's outside of JJJJJJJ

          ZZZ's. They are actually GGGG's, not KKKKKKK's, whose VVVVV's are

          LLLLLLL, either MMMMMMM or NNNNNNN, by the OOOOOOO ZZZZZ. The BBBBB's

        for this are FFFFF in PPPPPPP 1 of my PPPPP QQQQQQQ RRRRRRR, in the SSSSSSS

        TTTTTTT "UUUUUUU RRRRR," which is the at the very VVVVVVV of that PPPPPPP. [7]  . In PPPPPPP 3 of QQQQQQQ RRRRRRR, I WWWWWWW a XXXXXXX YYYYYYY to the ZZZZZZZ "what AAAAAAA's

must an BBBBBBB have if it is to be CCCCCCC of being what we are thereby DDDDDDD-ing in EEEEEEE-ing FFFFFFF

WWWWW's?" In PPPPPPP 3 of the present IIIII, I JJJJJJ forth a GGGGGGG HHHHHHH of my YYYYYYY to that

ZZZZZZZ. [8] See IIIIIII (2007). [9] After JJJJJJJ-ing a KKKKKKK that IIIIIII LLLLLLL in 2006, I MMMMMMM-ed him in NNNNNNN why (3) isn't the OOOOOOO

UUUUUU of (1). His PPPPPPP was that my UUUUUU was QQQQQQQ-RRRRRRR false and that my ZZZZZZZ didn't

SSSSSSS a PPPPPPP. (Out of the 20 or so TTTTTTT who publicly MMMMMMM-ed IIIIIII ZZZZZZZ's about his KKKKKKK,

only one UUUUUUU-VVVVVVV, WWWWWWW XXXXXXX MMMMMMM-ed a ZZZZZZZ that didn't YYYYYYY the ZZZZZZZ of AAAAAAAA'

BBBBBBB. XXXXXXX MMMMMMM-ed whether there were any CCCCCCC's to the BBBBBBB that DDDDDDD's such as (1)

EEEEEEE-ed that we FFFFFFF the GGGGGGG of HHHHHHH IIIIIIIII's. IIIIIII JJJJJJJ-ed his KKKKKKK's, LLLLLLL-ed at his

MMMMMMM, and then NNNNNNN with a OOOOOOO: "yes, but none that are PPPPPPP QQQQQQQ-ing." UUUUUUU-VVVVVVV's

RRRRRRR-ed at XXXXXXX and SSSSSSS-ed TTTTTTT at IIIIIII's UUUUUUU and VVVVVVV PPPPPPP to his ZZZZZZZ. They then WWWWWWW-ed to MMMMMMM ZZZZZZZ's which YYYYYYY-ed the XXXXXXX of IIIIIII's BBBBBBB and were

sometimes YYYYYYY-ed by ZZZZZZZ for the AAAAAAAA and BBBBBBB IIIIIII had CCCCCCC in his PPPPPPP to

XXXXXXX's DDDDDDD EEEEEEEE ZZZZZZZ. Apparently, only one UUUUUUU VVVVVVV, besides myself, had any FFFFFFFF's about GGGGGGG the

GGGGGGG of HHHHHHH (as IIIIIII to purely JJJJJJJ) HHHHHHH IIIIIIIII's. Which I KKKKKKK LLLLLLL, given

that we were at a MMMMMMM NNNNNNN, not a OOOOOOO PPPPPPP QQQQQQQ. [10] See AAAAAAAA (1973, 1984). [11] RRRRRRR, SSSSSSS TTTTTTT's have a UUUUUUU BBBBBBB. "To VVVVVVV like WWWWWWW", they XXXXXXX (this is not a

YYYYYYY), "you must first ZZZZZZZ like WWWWWWW. AAAAAAA it till you BBBBBBB it. If you AAAAAAA it CCCCCCC enough, you

won't be AAAAAAA-ing it anymore: the DDDDDDD you EEEEEEE on will now be your FFFFFFF GGGGGGG." HHHHHHH TTTTTTT's have the

IIIIIII BBBBBBB: "In JJJJJJJ to ZZZZZZZ like WWWWWWW", they KKKKKKK (again, this is not a YYYYYYY), "you must

first be WWWWWWW:  you must have his LLLLLLL's, MMMMMMM's, and so on." TTTTTTT's who NNNNNNN this OOOOOOO are PPPPPPP as "QQQQQQQ TTTTTTT's."

[12] The RRRRRRR must not be SSSSSSS-ed with the TTTTTTT. A TTTTTTT is UUUUUUU who himself has

VVVVVVV WWWWWWW's but KKKKKKK's that, for the most XXXXXXX, YYYYYYY either don't have them or do have them but ZZZZZZZ
 
to AAAAAAA with them.(BBBBBBB was a TTTTTTT; so was CCCCCCC DDDDDDD. These EEEEEEE's are FFFFFFF's

of mine.) The TTTTTTT is, in many GGGGGGG's, the HHHHHHH of the RRRRRRR. The VVVVVV "TTTTTTT", I must IIIIIII out, is JJJJJJJ. Sometimes the VVVVVV "TTTTTTT" JJJJJJJ's to UUUUUUU

who doesn't have WWWWWWW's or has KKKKKKK LLLLLLL's about whether it's MMMMMMM to AAAAAAA with them. But I will NNNNNNN the VVVVVV "TTTTTTT" to OOOOOOO to UUUUUUU who is PPPPPPP, not about whether WWWWWWW's are

PPPPPPP QQQQQQQ, but about whether TTTTTTT are RRRRRRR to AAAAAAA with them. [13] See SSSSSSS (1956). [14] See TTTTTTT (1949). [15] See UUUUUUU (1919, p. 168) for a UUUUUUU VVVVVVV. The VVVVVVV that I just WWWWWWW forth was, in

XXXXXXX of its YYYYYYY and its ZZZZZZZ, AAAAAAA BBBBBBB-ed on UUUUUUU's VVVVVVV. [16] This VVVVVVV is an CCCCCCC of one WWWWWWW forth by DDDDDDD EEEEEEE (1972). EEEEEEE was FFFFFFF-ing to

GGGGGGG a HHHHHHH IIIIIII-ed JJJJJJJ. But the KKKKKKK of EEEEEEE's VVVVVVV is the same as the KKKKKKK of

mine. [17] See LLLLLLL (1962) for LLLLLLL's own MMMMMMM of his VVVVVVV. [18] "AA" is NNNNNNN for "LLLLLLL's VVVVVVV."

[19] At least in OOOOOOO, unless OOOOOOO were PPPPPPP-ed in QQQQQQQ GGGGGGG's. It's OOOOO to KKKKKKK that, in

other RRRRRRR's, SSSSSSS-ing a WWWW P in a TTTTTTT of which it is the UUUUUUU VVVVVVV's P's

FFFFFFF. So, in the WWWWWWW XXXXXXX, OOOOOOO is YYYYYYY ZZZZZZZ of all AAAAAAA

RRRRRRR's, a UUUUUU being that BBBBBBB VVVVVVV's would be CCCCCCC, in any AAAAAAA

BBBBBB. But, so far as we DDDDDDD, they are CCCCCCC in all of them, without any of them EEEEEEE to

FFFFFFF any VVVVVVV's at all.
