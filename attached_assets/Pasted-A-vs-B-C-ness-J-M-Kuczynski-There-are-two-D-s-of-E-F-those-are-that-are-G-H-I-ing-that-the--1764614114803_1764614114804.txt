A vs. B C-ness

There are two D's of E F: those are that are G-H, I-ing that the J's K is in L with his own M's and N's, so that he does not O his M's and N's as M's and N's; and those that are G-P, I-ing that the J's K is not in L with his M's and N's, so that he does O his M's and N's as M's and N's. Of Q, the R will be S-ed: 'If T O's a U V of his N's as a N, then it is no W a N.' That is not X Y; a Z of him O's it for what it is; but a Z of him doesn't. More α, his β can γ the δ ε's; but his ζ's are not in L with his β; η they are in L with his N's, so that his β, though θ in ι of κ, λ's the μ ν that it would ξ π. 
An ρ of an G-P σ is τ; the υ-φ O's his M's and χ's and ψ's for what they are; but he is ω α1 by them, as his β, though θ in ι of κ, has no μ or β1 γ1 δ1 it. An ρ of an G-H σ is ε1: the ζ1 is η1 θ1 in his by N's; there is not, as there is with the υ-φ, an ι1 κ1 of λ1 that μ1's ν1 from, and ξ1's π1 on, the ρ1 N's in σ1's; the N's are, as it were, τ1 to, and υ1 of, the φ1 of the K in R. 
The χ1 'G-P σ' has ψ the ω1 α2 as the χ1 'β2', and the χ1 'G-H σ' has ψ the ω1 α2 as the χ1 'γ2.'  
It has been δ2 by ε2's that, ζ2 υ-φ's are η2 θ2-ι2---that, η2 to those α1 by κ2, they O λ2's as they are---ω, they are μ2 ν2 ξ2 in the π2's of their own N's; that, in ρ2 σ2's, there is not an β that O's τ2 the N's. For this υ2, ρ2 ε2's have φ2 so χ2 as to ψ2 that τ is ω2 a γ2, as α3 to a β2. 
It is Y that the υ-φ can β3 be γ3 θ1 in by his N's; and it is Y that the υ-φ's β may δ3 κ. 
But τ is ω ε3 not a γ2. And the υ2 is that, ζ2 the υ-φ can be θ1 in his own N's, those N's are ζ3 η3 on a C θ3 of ι3, κ3, in the σ2 of ε1 or any λ3 γ2, the N is μ3. 
In the σ2 of γ2, N's are the ν3 of a ξ3 to π3 ρ3 σ3's in the τ3 υ3. In the σ2 of β2, they are the ν3 of φ3 χ3 ψ3-ing or ξ ω3-ing α4 ρ3 σ3's. In the σ2 of the β4, γ4, those σ3's are not there; which is δ4 the β4 doesn't have ε4 ζ4-η4's to ρ3 θ4's ι4-ing his κ4's---ρ2 θ4's just λ4 to 'μ4 ν4 him. He ξ4 π4's on, ρ4, with his σ4 about the τ4's υ4-ing φ4 his χ4 or the ψ4 υ4-ing in his ω4 or α5. 
In the σ2 of the υ-φ, those σ3's are there, β5 they have been γ5 of their δ5 μ ν's; which is δ4, when the υ-φ is ε5 ζ5 of the η5's θ5-ing to his ι5, he κ5's with λ5 ζ4, μ5 ν5-ing and ξ5-ing with π5. He does not ξ4 π4 on: he ρ5's what he has been σ5; he is τ5 by it; and he υ5's it, μ2 φ5-ing so χ2 as to χ5 ψ5-by-ψ5 ω5's to it. What he doesn't do is ξ4 α6 the ψ5 μ4 ν4 him. He doesn't do this, β6 that ψ5 γ6 to him; and it γ6 to him β6, φ4 the δ6 of ε6's, he O's ι3 as it is and γ4 ζ6's when it is η6 to him as it is.
To θ6 ι6: The β4's N's are B in κ6, in the λ6 that they μ6 the ν6 ξ6 of his π6 of ι3; κ3 the ρ6's N's are A in κ6, in the λ6 that they are the σ6 of a τ6-ing of an υ6 ρ3 π6 of ι3, not the φ6 of, or χ6 of, ρ2 a π6.
