              A, B and C D on the E F

 

 

        What G of F would H in a I and J K, and why?

A and B L M N to this O; C L a

very M N.

   A's N is---P. A I and J K is one in which

there is no Q and therefore no F. A's R is that

Q is S T--a U that V and W and X

no Y: "Just as Z has α-ed the β γ, and as δ, or

the ε of ζ, has η-ed and θ-ed ι's κ, so has the F

λ-ed his μ, ν-ing every ξ of ο." (π: What it

Really ρ For, σ. 4)

      Of τ, the O υ: If there is no Q (no F),

then what will φ χ? A's N is that the very ψ that it is

ω the F's Ω to α1 is itself a β1 of the F: "The

most γ1 δ1 for ε1 and ζ1 is that they η1 to θ1

ψ...So ι1 as every κ1 of λ1, μ1, ν1, ξ1, and

ο1, π1 to ρ1 β σ1 into τ1 υ1; so ι1 as

most φ1 are out of χ1 ψ1-ing the ζ they ω1 to ψ1, Ω1-ing a α2

they β2 to Ω1, ψ will be γ2, and all the ζ1 on the δ2

can only ε2, but never ψ1 away with, ψ." (π: What it

Really ρ For, σ. 4)             

      The ζ2 here η2 to be that β θ2 are S

ι2 and, ι2-ed to their own κ2, λ2 in μ2 rather than

ν2 ξ2 ο2.

      B's π2 are M to A's. According to B,

φ1 are not ρ2 ξ2 towards one σ2: "So ι1 as τ2

υ2-ed φ2 with their χ2 ψ2.....they Ω1-ed I, ω2, α3 and

β3 α2, so ι1 as their γ3 δ3-ed, and as they ε3-ed to η3

the ζ3 of η3 and θ3 ι3." (κ3 on

λ3, σ. 9)

 φ1 μ3-ed ξ2, according to B, with the ν3 of

ξ3. ο3 π3-ed it ρ3 for φ1 to σ3 more than they

τ3-ed. When this υ3-ed, φ1 μ3-ed φ3-χ3 and, in ψ3 to

ω3 their Ω3 and φ3, α4-ed to η3 β4: " [F]rom the

γ4 it δ4-ed ε4 to any one ι to σ3 ζ4 η4 for θ4, λ3 ι4-ed, δ was κ4-ed, λ4 μ3-ed

ν4, and ξ4 ο4 μ3-ed π4 ρ4, which ι had to

σ4 with the τ4 of his υ4, and where φ4 and χ4 were ψ4

ω4 to Ω4 and α5 up with the β5." (κ3 on λ3, σ.

8) In other γ5, β θ2 are δ5 off Ω1-ing in ε5, ζ5 being

η5 between π and ξ3.

        There is a θ5 ι5 with B's R. While there may

be some κ5 to a λ5 (or μ5-ξ3) ν5 of ξ5, there

are some θ5 ο5: π5 of ρ5 in σ5 to τ5 and

υ5, π5 of φ5 χ5, π5 of ψ5, ω5 to a Ω5

α6 β6, π5 of γ6, and the δ6 to λ4 for every ε6

ζ6 that one η6. Also, it is θ6 that λ5 α2 is as ι6 and

κ6 as B λ6. ε5 μ6-ed one σ2 and were

ν6 ξ6 of ο6-ing π6 towards their own ρ6. In any

σ6, if λ5 α2 is so τ6, why don't φ1 υ6 for it λ1?

      A's φ6 is χ6 ψ6. A may be ω6 that the

F is Ω6 for some of the ψ that it α7 β7 to α1, and

she is γ7 ω6 that F δ7 ε7 very ζ7. But without the

F, η7 wouldn't be θ7-ed and there would be no ι7 of

κ7, and the F is therefore λ7 for all of the μ7

ν7 to α2.

      ξ7-ing it for η7-ed that the F is λ7 for ψ-ο7

and η7 π7, C ρ7 what he σ7 to as 'τ7',

this being the υ6 that the F should φ7 φ1 and χ7 φ1

ψ7 but should otherwise not ω7 with φ1's α2: "τ7 is

Ω7-ed, α8, to β8-ing γ8 by δ8 ε8 of ζ8

μ1 ο2. And it η8 γ8 as θ8 not only because in

most ι8 it is the most κ8 ε8 λ8 but because it is the

only ε8 which does not μ8 the ν8 or ξ8 ω7 of

ε1. It ο8 with the δ6 for 'π8 ξ1 ρ8' and χ7 

θ2 a σ8 to τ8 whether the υ8 of a φ8

χ8 are ψ8 to ω8 for the ο5 Ω8-ed with

it." (α9 to β9, σσ. 45-46)

      Is C ω6 that Y Q is γ9 Q? There

is ν6 δ9 ε9 for that α7: ζ9-η9-ed ι9

(θ9. the ι9 κ9) λ9 to μ9 and γ9 η9-ed ν9 (θ9. the ξ9

in its ο9 π9) λ9 to ρ9. More σ9, φ1 should τ9 ψ3 be δ3-ed to Ω1 the υ9 they φ9 to Ω1, and χ9 ψ9 

Q ω9 that. This does not Ω9 that C is ω6, but it

α0 that his R is β0 to be at γ0 δ0 ε0.

By ζ0, the π2 of A and B are not η0, since, as

θ0 ι0-ed, π and ζ5 κ0 to λ0 φ1 of the

ψ7 and μ0 that they φ9.
ν0 ξ0 is More ο0 than π0 ξ0
ρ.-σ. τ0


Most φ1, υ0-ing most φ0, χ0 on the ψ0 that ν0 ξ0 is to be ω0-ed in Θ0 of π0 ξ0; that θ2 σ3 Λ0 Π0-Σ0 Τ0 and that, in ν0-Υ0, these Τ0 are Φ0 Χ0-ed away from their Ψ0 Ω0 and Ξ0-ed into Π1 that, not being Π0-Σ0, are Σ1 to their own. 
This R is Τ1, and is at γ0 Υ1 ε0, where very ο0 Τ0 are Φ1-ed—Χ1 Ψ1-ing to Ω1 Ζ1 to one's Α2 and to the Β2 of Ω1 Γ2 Δ2. 
But this Ε2 Ζ2 cannot be Η2-ed with the Θ2 high Ι2 of Κ2 Λ2-ed by φ1, even after Μ2 Ν2 on their Ξ2 are Ο2-ed into Π2, to other φ1's Ρ2; nor can it be Η2-ed, even after φ1's Σ2 of Τ2 is Ο2-ed into Π2, with the Υ2 Φ2-ed by φ1, at the Χ2 of their own Δ2, to Ψ2 and to Ω2-Ξ5-ing Α3, as well as Β3 but Γ3 Δ3. 
Also, Ε3-ed how Ζ3, Η3, and Θ3-ing in Ι3 Κ3 most θ2 are, and yet how much Λ3, Μ3, and Ι3 Ν3 is Ξ3-ed in the Ο3 of Π3, such as Ρ3 and Σ3 Τ3, it is Υ3 to Φ3 that such Π3 are the Χ3 of Λ0 Ψ3 Ω3 θ2 Α4-ing their Β4 Ω0. It η2 rather as though the Γ4 is the Δ4 ζ2, Ε4 Φ6-ing, and there is an Ζ4 of π0 Η4 and, Θ4, of Ι4 per Κ4. 
A Λ4 is an π0 Μ4. But how well can you ω0 a Λ4 if you Ν4 to ω0 on its own Θ0? Pretty well but not Ο4 well. If you Π4-ed to ω0 its Ο3 in Θ0 of a Ρ4 on its Ξ2 to Ω1 or ρ9 or Σ4 you would Τ4 Υ3; but there would still be some Φ4-ed, and Χ4, Ο2. 
But Ψ4 you Π4-ed to ω0 π0 Λ4 in the Ω4-ing υ9. They Α5 Ν4 to Β5, ρ9 and Σ4 to the Γ5---but only to the Γ5--that their Δ5-ing to ψ1 so is λ7 for the Π3 Ε5-ed Ζ5 to Β5 and ρ9 and Σ4. In that σ6, I would Η5, you will Τ4 at γ0 as Υ3 as you Θ5-ed with your other Ι5, and Κ5 Λ5. Λ4-Ι4 can be ι0-ed in Θ0 of Λ4 Μ5, but not so much Ν5 Ο5. 
Π5, Ρ5-Ι4 can be ι0-ed in Θ0 of Ρ5-Μ5, but not so much Ν5 Ο5. Ψ3 Ω3 θ2—φ1 who Σ5 for Τ5: Υ5, in other γ5---can be ω4 as Φ5-ing σ6 of Π3; as Π3 of one, Χ5, or as Ψ5 Ζ6; or, most β0, as ρ6 of Π3 who σ3 an Η6 Θ6 τ9 that Γ4 and are therefore ω4, Ι6, as not being a Ξ2 of those Π3. And the Κ6 Τ0 that θ2 σ3 to Β5 and Λ6 Δ2 can be ω4 as being λ7 for the ξ5 for, and therefore Μ6 in Θ0 of, the Π3 to which they Ν6. Thus, the Ο6 Ψ1-ing to π0 ξ0 can be Η2-ed with the υ6 that ν0 ξ0 is Δ4. 
But the Π6 η2 not to be Ρ6. It is very Υ3 to Σ6 ν0 Ο3—be the ν0 in Ο in a Τ6 Υ6 or an Φ6-ed Φ6-Υ6, such as an Χ6-ed Ψ6---on the ψ0 that these Π3 Ω6 Α7 of the Ο3 of so Β7 Γ7 of one—of so Β7 Δ7-Ε7 Ζ7 Η7 Θ7. Ι7 of Υ0 where there are well-Κ7-ed and Ω1 Ζ1 to Λ7 well Μ7 or where there Ν7 well Κ7-ed Β2 of Ο7 Π7 of Δ2---Ι7 of such Ρ7, φ1 are Σ7-ed to χ7 Υ3 too much Τ7, and in Υ3 too well-Κ7-ed Φ7, to Ω2-Ξ5-ing Χ7 and Ψ7 than can be Ω7-ed for in Θ0 of the Ι5 that Π3 are Θ4 Π3 of Ψ3 Ω3 θ2.
