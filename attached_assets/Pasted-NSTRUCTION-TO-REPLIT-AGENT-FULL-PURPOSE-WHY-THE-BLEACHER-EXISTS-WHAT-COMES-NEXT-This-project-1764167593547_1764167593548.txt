NSTRUCTION TO REPLIT AGENT — FULL PURPOSE + WHY THE BLEACHER EXISTS + WHAT COMES NEXT

“This project is building a GPT-bypass humanizer.
The core idea is: AI text must be rewritten using REAL HUMAN sentence geometry so that it passes detectors while preserving the user’s meaning.

To accomplish this, the project has three layers.
Everything you build must support these three layers.

LAYER 1 — WHY THE BLEACHING TOOL EXISTS (WHAT IT IS FOR)

The bleaching tool you already built is NOT the humanizer.
It is the tool that extracts the structural patterns of real human sentences.

When the user uploads ANY human-written text, the bleaching tool:

splits the text into individual sentences

bleaches each sentence (variables instead of content)

computes sentence metadata (length, tokens, clause count, punctuation, etc.)

returns each sentence as a JSON object

The purpose of this is to build a growing library of human sentence patterns.
This file will be called sentence_bank.jsonl.
It will live inside THIS SAME APP.
It will be used later for humanization.

This is the “raw material” the humanizer needs.

LAYER 2 — WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT (MATCHING ENGINE)

Once the sentence bank exists inside the app, the next major feature will be:

A matching system that takes one AI sentence and finds the closest human sentence pattern in the sentence bank.

It matches by:

similar length

identical clause count

identical punctuation

similar bleached structure

This finds a human sentence that has the same overall shape as the AI sentence.

This prevents distortion.

LAYER 3 — FINAL PURPOSE (THE ACTUAL HUMANIZER)

After a match is found, the final feature will:

take the human sentence pattern

take the original AI sentence meaning

ask the LLM to rewrite the AI sentence INTO that pattern while keeping meaning intact

This produces human-like, detector-safe text with full content preservation.

This is the final output of the app.

SUMMARY FOR YOU (THE AGENT)

The bleaching tool is Step 1.
It exists so the app can build its own library of human sentence patterns.
Steps 2 and 3 (matching + rewriting) will use that library to produce humanized text.
All development should move toward this three-layer pipeline.
