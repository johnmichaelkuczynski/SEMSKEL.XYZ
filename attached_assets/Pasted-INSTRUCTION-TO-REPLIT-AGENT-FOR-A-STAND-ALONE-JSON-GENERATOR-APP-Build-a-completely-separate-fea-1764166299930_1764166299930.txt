INSTRUCTION TO REPLIT AGENT (FOR A STAND-ALONE JSON GENERATOR APP)

“Build a completely separate feature in this app whose ONLY purpose is to take any uploaded text file and convert it into a downloadable JSONL file of bleached sentences with metadata.
Nothing is stored permanently inside the app.
The user must be able to download the JSONL file directly to their computer.
The app will NOT keep or save any data after download.
This tool must work for any text input.”

THE FEATURE MUST DO THIS EXACTLY:
1. Add a front-end upload interface

A simple page with:

a file upload button

a “Process Text” button

a link/button to download the generated JSONL output

Call the page:
/make-json

2. Back end: create a processor route

Create a server route (e.g., /api/process-text) that:

receives the uploaded text file

reads its contents

splits the text into individual sentences

processes each sentence using the logic below

outputs a downloadable JSONL file

3. For each sentence, generate the following fields:

original

bleached (use existing bleach(sentence) function)

char_length

token_length

clause_count

clause_order

punctuation_pattern

structure

4. Write ALL results into a temporary file

Create a file:

output_<timestamp>.jsonl


Write one JSON object per line.

Use EXACTLY this format (examples below):

🔥 EXAMPLE LINES THE MODEL MUST MATCH EXACTLY
Example 1:
{"original":"When the engine overheated, the system crashed.","bleached":"When X Y, Z.","char_length":49,"token_length":7,"clause_count":2,"clause_order":"subordinate → main","punctuation_pattern":",.","structure":"When X Y, Z."}

Example 2:
{"original":"He left early.","bleached":"X V1-ed A1.","char_length":14,"token_length":3,"clause_count":1,"clause_order":"main → subordinate","punctuation_pattern":".","structure":"X V1-ed A1."}

Example 3:
{"original":"Although the rain stopped, the streets stayed wet.","bleached":"Although X, Y.","char_length":53,"token_length":8,"clause_count":2,"clause_order":"subordinate → main","punctuation_pattern":",.","structure":"Although X, Y."}

Example 4:
{"original":"People moved slowly through the streets.","bleached":"F1 V1-ed A1 through the F2.","char_length":43,"token_length":6,"clause_count":1,"clause_order":"main → subordinate","punctuation_pattern":".","structure":"F1 V1-ed A1 through the F2."}

Example 5:
{"original":"Nothing unusual happened.","bleached":"Nothing A1 V1-ed.","char_length":25,"token_length":3,"clause_count":1,"clause_order":"main → subordinate","punctuation_pattern":".","structure":"Nothing A1 V1-ed."}

5. After the file is generated

Return a link so the user can download the JSONL file directly to their computer.

After the download, the temporary file may be deleted.

6. NOTHING is stored inside the app.

No permanent DB

No saving inside the project

No accumulation

Each run is independent

🎯 FINAL PURPOSE (TELL THE AGENT THIS)

“This tool must function as a UNIVERSAL JSONL generator:
I upload any text → I get a download link for a JSONL file.
Nothing is saved, nothing is stored, nothing is trapped.”
