J, O, and E on X-ism J, O, and E on S-ism C: What Do These A's Θ? Part 1 What is R? Three P's
     What is R, and does it have any λ? There are many different α's to each of these β's, but ultimately any given α to either β γ's one of three δ's:
1 One of U A, such as
we would presumably find among ε's ζ-ing 3,500 η's ago;
2 One of R, such as we would find
in someone, such as F, whose ι involved κ-ing R, and therefore making an μ out of it, as opposed to having R; or
3 One of C and ν
A, such as we find in W J, R O, and M E, these being ξ's who took it upon themselves to π ρ σ X-ism, such as we find in F, with τ φ of the χ's involved in being ψ. In the ω work, the ω1's of J, O, and E will be ω2-ed, ω3-ed, ω4-ed, and ω5-ed. It will be ω6-ed that they have much the same ω1 as to the ω7 ω8 of R and also as to its Ψ ω9. In their ω1, the ω10 of ψ ω11 is that this ω12 is not all that there is and, moreover, that one cannot fail to have this ω1 while ω13-ing Ψ ω14. Each of these A's ω15's that there exist Ψ-ly ω16, ω17-ω18-ed ω19's and ω20's; but they also hold that such ω21's, whether they know it or not, hold some ω22 of the ω1 just ω23-ed. They also hold that when ε's genuinely do not have this ω1, they ω24 to various different ω25's of Ψ ω26. It must be ω2-ed at the ω27 that, when these A's refer to "R", they are typically referring to its ω28, ω7 ω29, not to its ω30, ω31 ω29. At the same ω32, none of these A's is

referring to the ω33 of someone who, in the 21st ω34, ω35's himself as "S." For ω36's to be ω37-ed, the ε who ω17-ω35's as "S" is in much the same ω38 as a ω17-ω23-ed ω20. 21st ω34 'S-ism', so these A's would say, is just another ω39 of ω40 ω41 and is therefore not an ω42 of
the ω43 S-ism that these A's have in ω44 but of its ω45. Let us start by ω35-ing the previously ω46-ed δ's of U A, R, and C A. U A
     Someone is genuinely U-ly A-ing of R if they don't even know of the ω47 of not A-ing it. It is not ω48 for a ω49 of any ω40 ω50 to have this δ. So-ω51-ed "ω52's" are not U-ly A-ing of R. A ω40 ω53 or ω54 ω52's ω55's to be a ω52. He ζ's in a ω50 of non-ω52's; he has ω56 to ω57's, ω58's, and ω59's that ω60 ω1's ω61 to his own. The ω40 ω52 is ω62-ing to non-ψ ω1's and to ψ but non- ω52's ω1's. By ω63, the S-ism of the ω64 ω65 ω66 is not a ω67, that is to say, it is not a ω68 against some other ω1. Moreover, the ω66's ω1's do not ω60 mere ω69 or ω70 to some ω71 of ω72 ω73's. In ω74-ing that some ω75 of ω76 ω60's the ω77 of a ω78 ω79, he isn't ω70-ing to ω72 ω73's or to a ω80 ω81. He ω74's it because it is how he ω82-ly ω83's the ω12, not because he has been ω84-ed that this is how he should ω83 the ω12. The ω40 ω52 is in a very different ω38: his ω85's are the ω86 of a ω87 ω88 of ω89, usually ω90-ed by ω91 ω92 ω93. R
     There are two very different ω25's of ψ ω94-ism: the ω95 ω96 and the ω97 ω96. An ω98 of the ω95 ω96 is someone, e.g. F, who genuinely has a ω99 ω12 ω1 and, on that ω100, simply doesn't accept a ψ ω12 ω1. An ω98 of the ω97 ω96 is anyone whose ω94-ism is simply a ω101 of ω102-ing in or ω103-ing ahead. ε's often ω104 ω20 ω105's because they want to ω102 in with ω106's or because they ω74 ω107-ship in

such a ω105 to be a ω108 of ω109. This ω25 of ω94-ism is presumably a ω110 ω111 of the ω112 of ω95 ω94-ists— as in, the latter ω113-ed our ω114 in such a ω101 as to make a non- ψ ω1 be ω72-ly ω115—but the ω33 involved is much ω116 that involved in ψ ω52-ism than it is to that involved in ω95, X-ism-ω117-ed ω94-ism. In most ω118's, today's ω20 or ω119 ω120 is simply ω121-ing the ω122, just as the ω123-ω124 was one ω125 η's ago, and his ω1's are likely to be equally ω126. So even if what the ω40 ω20 ω74's is more ω127 than what a ω128 ω129 ω74's, his ω36's for ω74-ing it may well be equally ω7 and equally ω130. Indeed, the ω131-ω132's that ω133 'ω134' ω135 are ω136 with those that ω133 ψ ω52-ism. C A
     There are two ω101's to be ν about R: ω137-ly and non-ω137-ly. F was ω137-ly ν about R. In his ω1, G ω60's the ω138, and R exists to ω133 various ω139 and ω72 ω9's (e.g. ω140-ing ω141, ω142-ing ω143 towards ω144 ω145's, and ω146-ing ω147). W J was non- ω137-ly ω148 about R. He didn't deny that R's ω149-ed (or used to ω149) various ω72 ω9's. Nor did he deny that R was ω150 to ω151 ω152's of the ω96 that F would later provide. His P is not so much that those P's are ω153 as it is that they are ω154. There are indeed ω155 ω156's about R, J ω157's, but there are also non-ω155 ω156's; and, so he ω158's, it is ω156's of the non-ω155 ω96 that the very ω10 of R lies. It is ω159 to note that there are, or at least could be, both ω137 and non-ω137 ω156's about R. J himself makes this ω160. R is a Ψ ω161 and can be ω162-ed as such. It can be ω2-ed why ε's are ψ, just as it can be ω2-ed why ε's do S. It could well be that N ω163-ed himself into his σ ω164's as a ω101 of ω165-ing from ω166 ω167 ω168's, and it might well be that M L's ψ ω169 is to be ω170-ed in much the same ω101. But, as J himself says, the Ψ ω171 is not always the ω172 ω173. σ P's must be ω174-ed on their own ω175's, and it is at least ω48 that the same is ω176 of ψ P's. Consequently, even if everything F says about R is ω177—even

if G is simply a ω178 of ω147 and even if 'ω179 ω180's' are mere ω68's against ω181 ω182's---it doesn't follow that R is nothing other than a ω183 ω184. Supposing that S becomes a ω185 ω186 because he ω187's from ω188 ω189, it doesn't follow that his ω164's are nothing but ω42's of ω189-ω190-ed ω191. Similarly, supposing that M L ω192-ed to G because his own ω138 ω193-ed him as a ω194, it doesn't follow that his ω195 ψ ω196 is nothing but an ω42 of ω197 over not having ω198-ed a ω138. Of ω199, it will be ω2-ed that, whereas S has both ω28 and ω30 ω29's, R is pure ω200, there being nothing ω201 ω202-ing to the various Ψ ω161's involved in it. But, of ω199, this is precisely what J, O, and E β, and it is to their ω112 that we now ω192. In what follows, we will use the ω175 'ω203 ω12' to refer to the ω12 qua ω204 that can be ω205-ed through our ω206's and through σ ω207 of the ω208 thereby made ω209 to us. It must be ω210-ed in ω44 that, in this ω211, 'ω203' means 'ω212 either through our ω206's or through ω148 ω213 from what our ω206's ω214 to us.'

Part 2 J's P R vs. S
     According to J, the ω10 of R is that the ω203 ω12 is not the ω172 ω12, since an 'ω215 ω216' ω217's and ω218's the ω203 ω12, giving it ω219 and ω220 ω221:

Were one ω222-ed to ω223 the ω224 of R in the ω225-est and most ω226 ω175's ω48, one might say that it ω227's of the ω85 that there is an ω228 ω216, and that our ω229 ω230 lies in ω231-ly ω232-ing ourselves thereto. This ω85 and this ω232 are the
ψ δ in the ω233.[1]

     This ω234 ω235-ed: According to the σ ω236, the ω12 is just a ω237, ω227-ing of so many ω238's ω239-ed by so many

ω240's, and is to be ω174-ed in much the same ω101 as a ω237. According to R, says J, this is not the ω118, since the ω12 ω205-ed to us through our S is not all there is, the ω36 being there also exists an 'ω215 ω216' that ω217's the ω203 Moreover, this ω215 ω216 gives the ω12 ω219 and it gives ω241 ω242 ω79's a ω243. A given ε's ω224 is ω244 to the ω245 that he is on the ω246 ω29 of this 'ω215 ω216' and ω247 to the ω245 that he is on the ω153 ω29 of it. R as Ψ-ly N
     Notice that, in this ω248 ω234, J is ω249-ing a ω250- β; he is just saying what, in his ω1, the ω10 of R is. But it is the very ω243 of this ω112 of J to ω251 a ω250-β about this ω252: and that β is that even if it is ω253, we ω254 from ω74-ing it to be ω176. J's ω255 is that, even if G does not in ω256 exist, ω85 in G gives one a ω257 ω258 of G-like ω259. In a ω260—ω74-ing it makes it ω201:

We can act AS IF there were a G; feel AS IF we were ω261; ω262 ω263 AS IF she were ω264 of ω265 ω266's; lay ω267's AS IF we were to be ω268; and we find then that these ω260's do make a ω269 ω270 in our ω220 ω224. Our ω271 THAT these ω272 μ's ω43-ly exist ω273's thus to be a ω264 ω274 in praktischer Hinsicht, as K calls it, or from the ω160 of ω1 of our ω275, for a φ of WHAT they might be, in ω118 we were ω276-ed ω277-ly to ω278 them. So we have the ω279 ω161, as K ω280's us, of a ω44 ω74-ing with all its ω259 in the ω201 ω281 of a ω71 of ω282's of no one of which it can ω283 any ω284
ω285. [2]

     In and of itself, this ω286 only says that the ω111's of ω85 in G are in some ω287's ω288 with those of G's ω43-ly ω289-ing; it does not say what those ω111's are or whether they are ω230.


But one X later, J Y-s that Z in G W-s us A and is therefore B:

The C of D can indeed E itself so F-ly to our G of Z that our whole H is I-ed through and through, so to speak, by its sense of the J of the K Z-ed in, and yet that K, for L of M N, can hardly be said to be O to our P at all. It is as if a Q of R, without S or T, with no U V whatever, might nevertheless be W-ly X-ed with an Y Z for AA BB; and as if, through the CC DD of its EE by FF GG-ing and HH-ing in its II, it might be JJ-ly KK-ed to LL MM and NN. Such a Q of R could never give you an OO PP of the QQ that had the RR of SS-ing it so W-ly; yet of their TT, and of their UU for its H, it would be VV-ly WW through
every XX of its YY. [3]

       And therein ZZ-s the AAA BBB of The CCC of DDD EEE (TVRE), to wit: A FFF-s from Z, and GGG from HHH. An III in J' JJJ
     There is a KKK LLL in what J is MMM-ing. One cannot NNN A from a Z that one doesn't have. So if OOO who

doesn't Z in G is to NNN A from such a Z, he
must PPP himself have that Z and therefore PPP himself Z what he doesn't QQQ-ly Z. But if he RRR-s that, he is SSS-ing himself TTT, not UUU, since he is VVV-ing the WWW of his own Z-XXX and also therefore of any other YYY ZZZ of his whose WWW AAAA-s on that of his Z-XXX. A BBBB CCCC
     But there is a DDDD EEEE FFFF this GGGG one. The AAA BBB of TVRE is not HHHH-ly that we should Z in a IIII JJJJ. It is rather that, whether we KKKK it or not, our LLLL, MMMM NNNN, and OOOO are PPPP to the QQQQ that there is a G who RRRR-s a SSSS TTTT. The UUUU-VVVV WWWW XXXX YYYY-ly and ZZZZ-ly AAAAA-s that this QQQQ, and the UUUU-VVVV BBBBB CCCCC-s them. But even though their DDDDD EEEEE, Y-s J, their MMMM FFFFF do not, and in each GGGGG the YYY HHHHH IIIII for JJJJJ, KKKKK, and LLLL is that of the WWWW XXXX:

Nevertheless, if we MMMMM on NNNNN's whole OOOOO H as it PPPPP-s, on the H of QQQQQ that RRRRR in them SSSSS from their TTTTT and UUUUU, and that they VVVVV and WWWWW XXXXX, we have to YYYYY that the ZZZZZ of it of which AAAAAA can give an BBBBBB is CCCCCC DDDDDD. It is the ZZZZZ that has the EEEEEE FFFFFF-ly, for it has the GGGGGG, it can HHHHHH you for IIIIII, and JJJJJJ KKKKKK, and LLLLLL you down with MMMMMM. But it will NNNNNN to OOOOOO or PPPPPP you all the same, if your QQQQQQ RRRRRR are SSSSSS to its
TTTTTT.[4]

     J then Y-s that the UUUUUU-VVVVVV of WWWWWW, and indeed of what we might XXXXXX YYYYYY, ZZZZZZ in this AAAAAAA YYYYYY BBBBBBB:

If you have RRRRRR at all, they come

from a CCCCCCC DDDDDDD of your EEEEEE than the GGGGGG DDDDDDD which AAAAAA FFFFFFF-s. Your whole GGGGGGG H, your HHHHHH, your IIIIII, your JJJJJJ, your KKKKKK, have LLLLLL the MMMMMM, of which your NNNNNN now OOOOOO-s the PPPPPP of the QQQQQQ; and RRRRRR in you SSSSSS-ly TTTTTT that that QQQQQQ must be UUUUUU than any KKKKKK-VVVVVV AAAAAA WWWWWW, however XXXXXX,
that may YYYYYY it.[5]

     It is in the ZZZZZZ of these AAAAAAA that J' BBBBBBB of CCCCCCC is to be DDDDDDD. According to J, CCCCCCC EEEEEEE are 'FFFFFFF', 'GGGGGGG', and 'HHHHHHH'; and they are also IIIIIII as being 'JJJJJJJ', i.e. as being KKKKKKK of LLLLLLL, as opposed to MMMMMMM. What this NNNNNNN-s is that CCCCCCC EEEEEEE are about OOOOOOO PPPPPPP and OOOOOOO one's 'QQQQQQQ RRRRRRR', for SSSSSSS of a TTTTTTT UUUUUUU, VVVVVVV to the WWWWWWW. XXXXXXX-ly, YYYYYYY who ZZZZZZZ AAAAAAA BBBBBBB, as J himself CCCCCCC-s out, have CCCCCCC EEEEEEE (or EEEEEEE DDDDDDD thereto), and so do YYYYYYY who ZZZZZZZ EEEEEEE. AAAAAAA BBBBBBB and EEEEEEE are both FFFFFFF GGGGGGG, HHHHHHH-ing that they IIIIIII the JJJJJJJ of KKKKKKK LLLLLLL between MMMMMMM; and this NNNNNNN OOOOOOO-ly PPPPPPP-s the QQQQQQQ that CCCCCCC EEEEEEE are about RRRRRRR, as RRR-s the NNNNNNN that SSSSSSS TTTTTTT are UUUUUUU GGGGGGG. In VVVVVVV, J' WWWWWWW XXXXXXX-s to be that it is not QQQ-ly up to us whether or not to 'Z', since Z is YYYYYYY into our YYY ZZZZZZZ. J is not AAAAAAA the BBBBBBB EEEEEE that OOO CCCCCCC now should have the same DDDDD as OOO CCCCCCC 12,000 EEEEEEE ago. Rather is AAAAAAA the non-BBBBBBB EEEEEE that however FFFFFFF our DDDDD may GGGGGG, the HHH that are IIIIIII into our JJJJJJJ NNNNN KKKKKKK are LLLLLLL to those of the MMMMMM than of the non-MMMMMM NNNNNNN. OOOOOOO 3 O' PPPPPPP The QQQQQQQ: What It Isn't
     O' PPPPPPP is that the RRRRRRR of MMMMMM SSSSSSS is the sense that the TTTTTTT is UUUUUUU by a VVVVVVV that cannot WWWWWWW be XXXXXXX

through YYYYYYY ZZZZZZZ, let alone sense-AAAAAAA. O BBBBBB-s to this CCCCCCC VVVVVVV as 'the QQQQQQQ' (from DDDDDDD: EEEEEEE for FFFFFFF or GGGGGGG VVVVVVV). In HHHHHH to IIIIIII what the QQQQQQQ is, Y-s O, we must be very JJJJJJJ about what it isn't. G, KKKKKKK of as a LLLLLLL of MMMMMMM-NNNNNNN, is not the QQQQQQQ. Quite the OOOOOOO, Y-s O. If G is KKKKKKK of as an PPPPPPP who QQQQQQQ on Mt. RRRRRRR, then there is SSSSSSS TTTTTTT about him, and he is therefore the very OOOOOOO of QQQQQQQ. UUUUUUU the same VVVVVVV if G is KKKKKKK of as being WWWWWWW YYYYYYY and ZZZZZZZ and AAAAAAA; for thus KKKKKKK, G is BBBBBBB a NNNNNNN, albeit one CCCCCCC of the DDDDDDD EEEEEEE, and there is therefore SSSSSSS TTTTTTT or 'QQQQQQQ' about him. For this FFFFFFF, O Y-s that, if indeed G is GGGGGGG-HHHHHHH, GGGGGGG-AAAAAAA, and the like, those are IIIIIII "JJJJJJJ" KKKKKKK of his, HHHHHHH-ing that it is not in LLLLLLL of his MMMMMM them that he is G. To be G is not to be a NNNNNNN but is rather to be the 'QQQQQQQ' VVVVVVV that OOOOOOO-s the TTTTTTT. Also, the QQQQQQQ is not to be PPPPPPP with the QQQQQQQ. For a RRRRRRR to SSSSSSS is for a TTTTTTT UUUUUUU to VVVVVVV WWWWWWW of XXXXXXX YYYYYYY. The ZZZZZZZ that a TTTTTTT UUUUUUU is AAAAAAA XXXXXXX YYYYYYY is BBBBBBB another CCCCCCC; and were that CCCCCCC to DDDDDDD EEEEEEE, it would not be a FFFFFFF of a YYYYYYY TTTTTTT GGGGGGG but a HHHHHHH IIIIIII of the JJJJJJJ such a TTTTTTT GGGGGGG is KKKKKKK. LLLLLLL-ly, the QQQQQQQ is not MMMMMM with, or even NNNNNNN-ly an OOOOOOO of, the QQQQQQQ. The QQQQQQQ: What It Is
     O RRR-s not HHHH say the QQQQQQQ is, but he PPPPPPP-s some of its QQQQQQ KKKKKKK:
     *The QQQQQQQ is either RRRRRRR SSSSSS-ing or TTTTTTT-ing (more on this below). *UUUUUUU of it VVVVVVV-s a WWWWWWW of XXXXXXX—HHHHHHH-ing that VVVVVVV-s a WWWWWWW of YYYYYYY ZZZZZZZ in it and also of AAAAAAA of BBBBBBB into it. *In being CCCCCCC of it, one has a sense of one's DDDDDDD and, for that FFFFFFF, of there being a EEEEEEE FFFFFFF GGGGGGG. *We HHHHHHH the QQQQQQQ when we IIIIIII to JJJJJJJ KKKKKKK, and also when we LLLLLLL MMMMMMM and NNNNNNN OOOOOOO. *The RRRRRRR PPPPPPP by QQQQQQQ RRRRRRR in those who are not SSSSSSS by TTTTTTT YYYYYYY VVVVVVV-s their being CCCCCCC of the QQQQQQQ. *The QQQQQQQ is WWWWWWW, a XXXXXXX (one not YYYYYYY-ly ZZZZZZZ by O) being that its AAAAAAA BBBBBBB CCCCCC DDDDDDD on NNNNN UUUUUUU and also

EEEEEE them a sense of FFFFFFF. RRRRRRR and GGGGGGG
     The QQQQQQQ HHHHHHH-s RRRRRRR or GGGGGGG, Y-s O. I KKKKKK that IIIIIII are JJJJJJJ, but I also IIIIIII them, since, being KKKKKKK, they are LLLLLLL MMMMMM-NNNNNNN OOOOOOO of myself, and I am therefore not PPPPPPP of them. I am PPPPPPP of QQQQQQ, such as RRRRRRR and SSSSSSS, that I KKKKKK to be JJJJJJJ and that are TTTTTTT UUUUUUU to me. If I VVVVVVV a WWWWWWW XXXXXXX and YYYYYYY to IIIIIII such QQQQQQ, they would to that ZZZZZZZ AAAAAA to BBBBBB me, though I would still be CCCCCC-ly DDDDDD of them. EEEEEE-ly, I am not FFFFFF by OOO who GGGGGG-s HHHHHH than myself, since there is SSSSSSS TTTTTTT to me about being IIIIII to GGGGGG a 100-JJJJJJ KKKKKK in 11 LLLLLL, as opposed to twelve LLLLLL. I would be FFFFFF by MMMMMM who could NNNNNN an OOOOOO PPPPPP in QQQQQQ RRRRRR from SSSSSS, since, not MMMMMM TTTTTT UUUUUU myself, I would not HHHH IIIIIII what was VVVVVV in his MMMMMM this WWWWWW. But if I myself XXXXXX this WWWWWW, or at least YYYYYY what was VVVVVV in this other NNNNNNN's MMMMMM it, I would AAAAAA to be FFFFFF by his MMMMMM it. The RRRRRRR-SSSSSS-ing and the TTTTTTT-ing are what we ZZZZZZ to be AAAAAA. If BBBBBB CCCCCC, they would be DDDDDD-ly TTTTTTT-ing, since, because they would be AAAAAA, EEEEEE FFFFFF could not WWWWWWW ever IIIIIII them. And GGGGGG, if they CCCCCC, would be DDDDDD-ly RRRRRRR-SSSSSS-ing for the same FFFFFFF mutatis mutandis. RRRRRRR and SSSSSSS are TTTTTTT-ing to YYYYYYY who do not IIIIIII them and to whom they therefore might as well be AAAAAA, and they are not TTTTTTT-ing to those who HHHHHH them IIIIII-ly and for whom they are therefore EEEEEE XXXXXXX JJJJJJJ. KKKKKK LLLLLL is RRRRRRR-SSSSSS-ing to those who have no MMMMMM how it NNNNNNN into AAAAAAA, and to whom it therefore has a AAAAAA OOOOOOO, but not to KKKKKK PPPPPP, who do have such an MMMMMM and to whom it therefore has no such OOOOOOO. The QQQQQQQ as QQQQQQ of RRRRRRR
     O never HHHH Y-s what the QQQQQQQ is. He Y-s what it isn't, and he SSSSSS off a few of its QQQQQQ KKKKKKK. But he can't HHHH TTTTTT it. The FFFFFFF for this, UUUUUUU to what O himself Y-s, is not that the QQQQQQQ is DDDDDD-ly VVVVVV-WWWWWW. It is rather that O is XXXXX-ing as an YYYYYY UUUUUUU—one that ZZZZZZ AAAAAA of BBBBBBB—when the CCCCCC is that it is DDDDDDD a YYY QQQQQQ of some EEEEEEE, and the FFFFFFF 'what is the

QQQQQQQ?' is a YYY, not a GGGGGG FFFFFFF. When HHHHHHH to IIIIII a JJJJJJJ KKKKKK of the QQQQQQQ, the LLLLLL FFFFFFF is: When do YYYYYYY LLLLLLL it and when don't they LLLLLLL it? The MMMMMM is: They LLLLLLL it when they have their NNNNNN down. The OOOOOO's PPPPPP to EEEEEE is one of QQQQQQ and RRRRRRR SSSSSS. When one is IIIIIII to KKKKKKK, one is in a WWWWWWW of TTTTTT UUUUUUU. NNNNNNN and MMMMMMM OOOOOOO VVVVVVV a WWWWWW of WWWWWW. The XXXXX-in to J is JJJJJJJ. J CCCCCCC out that YYYYYYY under the YYYYYY of ZZZZZZ have EEEEEEE AAAAAA to those of the CCCCCCC BBBBBB, the FFFFFFF being that such EEEEEEE are about RRRRRRR, as opposed to CCCCCC. The DDDDDD's EEEEEE to EEEEEE is not one of RRRRRRR SSSSSS but of FFFFFF GGGGGG, and the HHHHHH's EEEEEE towards EEEEEE is one
of IIIIII GGGGGG, this being why there is SSSSSSS QQQQQQQ about EEEEEE for either. For the OOOOOO, EEEEEE is not to be JJJJJJJ but KKKKKK-ly LLLLLL, this being why he LLLLLLL-s it as QQQQQQQ. OOOOOOO 4 E's PPPPPPP The MMMMMMM and the NNNNNN
     According to E, the RRRRRRR of a OOOOOO-ly MMMMMM NNNNNNN's PPPPPP to the TTTTTTT is that he QQQQQQ-s it as being either MMMMMMM or NNNNNN. Unlike the DDDDDD, he RRR-s not QQQQQQ as it RRRRRR.


The more A-ly B a C is, the less he D's it as a mere E, and the more F he is to D a G or H or I of J as a K of a L M N, and therefore as 'O', or of a P such N, and therefore as 'Q.' The less B a C is, the more he D's it as a mere E, and the less F he is to D a G or a H as anything other than a G or a H. R vs. S T
     According to U, V W, this being the most B X of W, Y's of T as S. He does not D it as a R Z away from a α that becomes ever more β. On the contrary, he D's T as being like the γ. Indeed, his δ of T is very F ε'd on the γ. As a ζ of η θ, U is ι that this is how κ λ's initially μ'd of T. We ν now μ of T as being R, ξ that at some π our δ of T ο'd a ρ σ. According to U, it was τ υ that φ about this σ. Such

υ's, χ's U, ψ ω-ing Ω's (e.g. Ω1 Ω2-ing to Ω3, Ω4 being Ω5-ed the Ω6 Ω7's, or Ω8 Ω9-ing Ω10 into Ω11); and because these Ω's are of such Ω12 Ω13, Ω14-ing it Ω15 for them to be Ω16-ed, the Z of T is Ω17-ly a Z away from them and must therefore Ω18 a R Ω19. Ω20 5 Ω21-ing as the Ω22 of Ω23 Ω24's of Ω25 Ω26 for the T- Ω27-ation
     Ω28 to what U Ω29's, the σ from a Ω30 to a R δ of T couldn't Ω31-ly be a Ω32 of the Ω33 of Ω34. First of all, it Ω35'd Ω36-ly in the Ω37. Second, it Ω35'd in the Ω38 Ω39 to the Ω33 of Ω34. The Ω40 Ω41 of this σ, in both the Ω38 and Ω42, was the Ω43 of the Ω44-ed Ω45. This Ω35'd in Ω46 Ω47-ly 6,000 Ω48's ago.[6] Ω49 Ω50's in Ω51 were Ω52-ed to Ω53 Ω54, and this Ω55 of Ω56 Ω57-ing was then so Ω58-ed as to be Ω59 to Ω60 Ω61 Ω62's and also to be Ω59 to Ω56 the Ω44-ed Ω45. Once the Ω44-ed Ω45 was Ω63-ed, it
Ω64-ly Ω65-ed to the Ω66 of Ω24's of Ω25 and to the Ω66 of Ω67 Ω55's Ω68-ly Ω69 to Ω70 such Ω24's. It may Ω71 be that a Ω30 δ of T Ω72-ed a Ω73 Ω74 on Ω75 Ω76-τ Ω77's, such as the Ω78's and the Ω79's. It may be, for Ω80, that such a Ω81 is Ω82 in their Ω83's. (Indeed, we will Ω84 below that Ω83's of their very Ω85 Ω86 such a δ of T.) And it may be that such a Ω81 is Ω87-ed in their 'Ω88' Ω89 Ω90's. But as soon as there were Ω44-ed Ω91's, T Ω92 to be Ω93 of as R. This is a ζ of η θ. And the Ω94 is Ω95. With the Ω44-ed Ω45, and the Ω96 Ω66 of Ω24's of Ω25, Ω97 Ω92 into Ω98. Ω99-ly Ω100-ing, the Ω101 of a Ω102
C was Ω30. Each Ω103 was like the Ω104. There were no Ω105 Ω106's and no Ω107 Ω66. And, of Ω108, there were no Ω44-ed Ω91's and there was therefore no Ω71-Ω109-ed Ω110 that Ω111-ed into the α: no 'Ω103 Ω112'--no 1492 or 1776. 'Ω97' Ω113-ed no Ω114 than

one's Ω115 Ω116. Of Ω108, Ω117 were Ω118-ed Ω83's, and Ω83's Ω17-ly Ω119 Ω's that, if they Ω40-ly Ω35'd, did so in the α. But the Ω's Ω120-ed in Ω83's are Ω121 Ω93 of as Ω122-ing in a Ω123 T; for it Ω124's Ω125 Ω126 to Ω127 that the Ω's in Ω128 Ω129 Ω130-ing Ω131 Ω132-ed those in Ω133 in the Ω134 Ω135 by 17 Ω48's or by 112 Ω48's. In Ω136, it Ω124's Ω125 Ω126 to μ of a Ω137 of Ω40 Ω's Ω138-ing the Ω's in some Ω83 to Ω's Ω139 to that Ω83. Ω83's therefore do not Ω60 η Ω140 of Ω97. On the contrary, they Ω60 an Ω141 Ω140 of Ω142's Ω143-ed in a η α. Ω21-ing was Ω144-ed at Ω47-ly the same T that Ω34 Ω92 into Ω98, this F being what through U off. Ω21-ing was Ω144-ed first. As a Ω145, it became Ω31 for Ω4 to Ω146 Ω21-ing to the Ω147's, this being Ω34's Ω148 Ω (Ω149-ly Ω60-ed as Ω1 Ω150-ing Ω7's into a Ω151). Being a Ω32 of the Ω44-ed Ω45, Ω34 is the Ω152, not the Ω41, of the Ω27-ation of T. Υ as Ω153-Ω154 Ω23
     A Ω155 ψ's an Ω156 of Ω25, along with Ω69 Ω67 and Ω157 Ω158's. None of this can Ω159 in the Ω160 of Ω23. Ω161 Ω162 Ω163 Ω164's can Ω159 in the Ω160 of Ω23—and indeed Ω165 on its Ω160. But where there is Ω155, there are Ω17-ly Ω158's that are not Ω166-ly Ω167- Ω168-ed or Ω169-Ω170-ed and that can be Ω171-ed only on the Ω22 of Ω23-Ω168-ed Ω172 Ω173-ing. What U Ω120's as a σ from one X of υ to another— what he Ω120's as a σ from Ω76-τ to τ υ's—is not a σ between υ's at all. It is a σ from Ω174 to υ, Ω174 being the Ω175 of the Ω102 C and υ being the Ω176 that Ω174 is Ω177-ed with Ω153-Ω154 Ω155. Ω34 did not Ω178-ly Ω179 until Ω180's of Ω181 were Ω44-ed down and Ω182-ed; and those Ω180's had to be Ω182-ed, since Ω183-ed Ω184's wouldn't be Ω185 of Ω186-ing such a Ω187 and Ω188-ly Ω189-ed Ω190. Ω191 and Ω192 may have Ω193-ed out is Ω194 Ω195's that were Ω186-ed more by Ω196's than by Ω182-ed Ω180's. But they did not become Ω197-Ω198-ed υ's until, like Ω34, they Ω199-ed, and indeed Ω200-ed with, Ω69 Ω67 and Ω201 Ω180's of

Ω181. Ω202-ly, υ is not so much Ω76-Ω23 or Ω203- Ω23 as it is Ω153-Ω154 Ω23; it is not so much Ω204-Ω23 as it is the Ω23 of Ω153 Ω155's. As for what we now Ω205 to as 'Ω23', that is Ω206-Ω154 Ω23—the Ω23 of a Ω155 whose Ω207's into Ω208 have Ω193-ed to Ω209 the same Ω210 of Ω211 Ω212 as the Ω67 and Ω107 Ω180's ψ-ed in Ω213's of Ω25. Ω21-ing and Ω214
     Ω215 is about Ω216-ing Ω217's about the Ω218. (A Ω219 is Ω220-ing Ω221-ly if it Ω222-ly Ω223's when to Ω224 on a Ω225.) Ω214 is about Ω216-ing Ω217's about one's Ω215. (I am being Ω226 if I Ω223 that a Ω227 in Ω228 would be a Ω121 Ω229 of my Ω230 Ω231's than a Ω227 as a Ω232.) Can Ω233's be Ω226 without being Ω75? Ω234, but the Ω44-ed Ω45 Ω235-ly Ω124's it Ω236 than it would Ω237 be for Ω233's to be Ω238. Can Ω239 Ω213's be Ω226-ly Ω240-ed? Ω234, but a Ω75 Ω241 is Ω59 to do more in the Ω176 of Ω226-ly Ω240-ing itself than an Ω239 one. In the Ω38, our δ of T became R at about the same T that the first τ Ω242 Ω92 into Ω98. U Ω243's from this that Ω244 was Ω26 for the Ω27-ation of our T- Ω245. But this is Ω246-ly Ω247, Ω248 that there were many Ω76-τ Ω155's—some of them Ω249-ing back to 8,000 B.C.---whose δ's of T were quite as R as ours. Ω250 6 Ω174 and Υ Υ Not what Ω251, Ω252, and U are
Ω253-ing
     When Ω251, Ω252, and U Ω205 to 'υ', they are not Ω254-ing to υ at all, but rather to Ω102 Ω174. Ω255's of any Ω248 τ Ω242, or indeed of any υ Ω256-ly Ω257 of the Ω258, Ω259 to have Ω260's that are Ω261-ly Ω262-Ω263-able from those of Ω264 Ω265's. Yes—a Ω266 Ω267 Ω268's to have a few Ω269's here and there that his Ω204-B Ω270 does not have. But, first of all, is this really true? Does the Ω271 Ω266 Ω267 really Ω272 that Ω8 Ω273-ed on Ω10? Does he

Ω272 it in the same Ω126 in which he Ω272's that he is a C or that Ω274 Ω101 in Ω10? Or is it rather that this so-Ω275-ed Ω269 of his is more of
a Ω276 whose Ω277 is not so much to be true as it is to Ω278 a Ω279 of Ω280's? Second, and more Ω281-ly, even if the Ω266 Ω267 Ω40-ly Ω272's that Ω8 Ω273-ed on Ω10 and Ω282-ed from the
Ω283, his Ω284 of the Ω218 is almost Ω285-ly Ω286 with that of his Ω204-B Ω270. He doesn't Ω287 that there are Ω125 Ω288 in his Ω289 who are Ω26 for the Ω290's it Ω124's; he doesn't Ω287 that every other H and G that he Ω291's upon is a Ω292 Ω293. His Ω294 is Ω295-ed to a Ω161 and Ω296-ly Ω297-ed Ω298 of Ω299's Ω119-ing Ω300-ed α Ω301's and the like, which Ω299's—though Ω95-ly Ω247 and Ω302 if Ω303-ed as Ω304's of η θ—are Ω52-ed in a very Ω305-ed and, indeed, Ω226 Ω176. For Ω80, the Ω306 have many Ω269's, for Ω307 of a Ω121 Ω308, about Ω4, Ω8, Ω1, and Ω309 Ω310 that, if Ω303-ed on their own, are Ω95-ly Ω302 but that the Ω306 Ω229 as the Ω22 for Ω310-ly Ω311 Ω172 Ω158's, Ω312's to which the Ω306 Ω313 Ω314-ly Ω315 Ω316's, Ω101 Ω314-ly Ω317 Ω101's, have Ω314-ly Ω318 Ω319's, and whose Ω320's are Ω321-ly Ω322 free. The Ω306, despite Ω323-ing Ω324 Ω280's from Ω325 'Ω326's', like myself, D the Ω218 in the same Ω176. If I D a G, they D a G; and if they D a H, I D a H. Unlike the Ω102 Ω327, they don't Ω328 their Ω329's when Ω330, they don't D Ω331-Ω332's Ω333-ing in the Ω334 as Ω330 Ω335-Ω336's. Ω174 and Υ
     If the Ω306 aren't B, who is? So when Ω251, Ω252, and U Ω337 about 'υ', they cannot Ω31-ly be Ω338-ing this Ω308 Ω222-ly. B Ω288—such as the Ω306 and Ω339---are no more F than others to have 'Ω340' Ω341's of 'Ω342' Ω343's. They are no more F than others to D G's as Ω344-ing Ω335-Ω345's. What is F is they Ω52-ed to have such Ω269's but no longer do, these Ω346 Ω269's of theirs Ω323-ing Ω317 since Ω347-ed into mere Ω348's or Ω276's that Ω349 as Ω350's for Ω226-ly Ω351-ed out Ω352 and Ω67 Ω353's. When they Ω205 to υ, what Ω251, Ω252, and U are Ω254-ing

to is Ω102 Ω174. They are Ω254-ing to the Ω354 of somebody for whom Ω23 was Ω246-ly not an Ω355. They are not Ω254-ing to Ω348 of some Ω201 Ω353 of Ω181 that Ω356's to Ω357 a few Ω358's to Ω174; they are not Ω254-ing to the Ω359's of Ω191 and Ω192, which, though Ω360-ly Ω361-ing a Ω362 that Ω363-ed into a Ω364 or a Ω365-ing Ω366, are Ω69 and Ω188-ly Ω367 Ω368 Ω353's that Ω369 Ω370's between W and Ω371, Ω372 and Ω373, Ω374 and Ω375, and Ω376 and Ω377. The most Ω378-Ω379 Ω266 Ω267 Ω229's the Ω380 and has a Ω381 and Ω382's his Ω383's. His Ω280's may be Ω384-ly Ω324 from those of his Ω385, but his Ω386 Ω269's, with Ω387 and Ω388 Ω389's, are the same. The Ω390 that Ω251, Ω252, and U are Ω120-ing is not B, but Ω391. Ω392-ing that Ω252, Ω251, and U should not have Ω52-ed the Ω308 'υ' to Ω205 to Ω354 they had in Ω393, it does not Ω394 that what they Ω395 is Ω247—only that they could have Ω396-ed it more Ω397-ly. So what did they Ω398? To this we now Ω399. Ω20 7 Ω251, Ω252, and U on the Ω400's of Ω23
Ω251, Ω252, and U on Ω23
Ω23 Ω179's when Ω174 Ω401's. For the Ω265, there Ω218 is so many Ω402-ing Ω403's. There is nothing Ω404 or Ω405 about it.


Yes, there is much that the R-ist doesn't X and X's that he doesn't X. But for the R-ist, V-ns are just Q's in his X. They are not Y's. For the R-ist, some Z's of the A are B, others are C, and others are neither. But nothing is D, and nothing is E. For the R-ist, F has to do with G, not with H. Some I J's K better than others; they L to lower M N's, higher O's, and the like. But that's the P of it. For the R-ist, there is indeed F, but there is no higher F. F is another S of T. For the R-ist, the A is U. It is not a W-ing X1. It is just so much Y Z1. There do Z2-ing W-ing A1's, and a few of those are B1. But for the R-ist, C1, especially of the B1 D1, is an E1 and must therefore be F1-ed, with the G1

that 'F1-ing' it H1's I1-ing its J1 to an otherwise Y and non-B1 K1. For the R-ist, the A is an L1. It M1's only to be N1-ed. The R-ist sometimes O1's his P1-ist Q1 of R1 by S1-ing the T1 that he U1's to V1 the A, not N1 it. But to V1 the A is to W1 it X2-ly, usually in Y1 of Z3-ing so Z4-ly. J2, O2, and E2 on S-ism
For the S-ist, the A is a A2. For the S-ist, the A, though B2-ing its N1's, does not M1 only to be N1-ed. It is more of a B3 than an L1. And, like a B3, it is C2-ing with C1, and D2's one's C1 E3. For the S-ist, F is F2, not G in R1, G2-ed as it is not on G H2's about I2 J3 but on an K2 L2 with H3 and R1. For the S-ist, A1's are more M2 than Y Z1, the latter N2-ing mere O3's of the former, and the very P2 of an 'U Q2' is R2 to him. S2: What Do These T2's U2? Each of these T2's V2-ly W2's the X3-ing Y2's of S-ism. Too much R-ism is Z5, they Z6 to be A3-ing, the B4 C3-ing that at least some S-ism is D3 for E4 F3. But is this in G3 what they are A3-ing? Are they H3-ing a I3 to a J4 of S-ism? Do they K3 us to L3 R3's M3 and N3 a J4 of O4 P3? I would Q3 a very R4 S3. Their T3, I U3, is not that we should be more S4, but that we are already S4, even though we V3 not to W3 the X4's of our S-ism for what they are. What these T2's are A3-ing about S-ism is Y3 to what F4 A3's about Z7. G4 to F4, we cannot H4 I4. What we can do is J5-ly K4 ourselves to be I4 and, on that L4, M4 C1-N4's that O5 our Z7 and P4 Q4 our R5 J4. G4 to J2, O2, and E2, so

I am S4-ing, we cannot H4 non-S4. What we can do is J5-ly K4 that we are non-S4---T4 because we have U4-ly V4 to Z8 R-ism as a W4, as X5-ed to a Y4 Z9, of our S-ism—and on that L4 A4 B5's that C4 our D4-ly S4 E5's. [1] J2, W5.
