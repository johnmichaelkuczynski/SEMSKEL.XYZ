1.0 K1 as L-ing the M1 for the N1-ly

O1-able P1s on which N1 Q1 R-s


       An N1[1] H2 is one whose I2s, when J-ed, are

J-ed by their K2 with L2 M2. N2 is an

N1 H2; so is O2. Any P2 N1 H2 Q2s P1s that cannot be

J-ed by that H2 or, indeed, by any N1 H2. For

R2, when S-ing the T2 U2, and thus when V-ing O2

or N2, one must W2 that one's X2s Y2 one Z2 A3

about it. For if our L2 B3s C3-ed out to be D3s, then

any E3s F3-ed thereupon would be G3. But this P1 cannot itself be P2-en an N1 M1. More H3-ly, M2 cannot I3 you that it itself is a J3 of Z2

A3. K3s cannot L3-M3. Thus, a N3 could not

O3-ly P3 to Q3 R3 S3 for his T3 that his

X2s are Z2. For it is only through his X2s that he can U3

whether those V3s were even W3-ed, as opposed to X3-ly

Y3-ed, or what their Z3s were, A4-ing that they were in B4

W3-ed. Of C4, to the D4 that we are E4 to F4 to what G4, if

any, this or that H4 L2 B3 is I4, we do so on the

J4 of K4 L2 B3s. But when L4-ing that, M4 N4 at 4:00

am (O4-P4), I wasn't Q4-ly in the R4 of a S4-ing T4, I am

U4-ing the V4 of the B3s with which my T4-B3s

W4 to X4. In B2 our L2 B3s can Q3 only a Y4

M1 for the Z4s we A5 about this or that B5 C5:

Y4 to the P1 that those B3s are D5-ly Z2,

E5s can be F5-ed as to the G4 of H5 of this or that H4

C5. But we cannot I5-ly W2 that our J5 K5s areZ2 when L5-ing to M5 that J5-C5 is a I5 J3 of

A3 about the T2 U2. So, since the E3s N5-ed by O2 are F3-ed on L2

B3s, and therefore P5 that such B3s are D5-ly

Z2, O2 cannot Q5-ly R5 that S5, and neither, for

the T5 U5 V5, can any K4 N1 H2. Therefore, unless

that S5 can be J-ed, we U3 W5 about the T2

U2, and, as a X5, all of the N1 Q1s Y5. It is the Z5, not

of the A6, but of the B6-A6---of the C6, in K4 D6s--

-to Q3 that M1. The P1 that our X2s are a E6 J3 of A3 about

the T2 U2 is but one of F6 P1s on which N1

B1 G6s but for which no N1 M1 can be Q3-ed and

for which, therefore, a A1 M1 must be Q3-ed. It is the

H6 of this I6 to J6 the most K6 of these P1s and

to Q3 the L6 A1 M1s for them. 2.0   The S1 T1 U-ing V1   


 


        K1 is M6-ed with more N6 than most K4 H2s. One V5 for this is that it is a O6-N1 H2. But that is not the

only V5. P6 is a O6-N1 H2. But it isn't M6-ed

with N6. Why this Q6 R6? First of all, because of the S6 T6s of P6 to N1

H2s such as O2, U6 often W2 that, like O2,P6 must be N1. Also, the V6 of some W6s of

P6 to X6 and Y6 Z6 Q2s it A7 that,

even if P6 is O6-N1, it's B7 to C7 its D7s. Don't E7 a F7-G7 in the H7. But there is another V5 why, despite it's being I7 as O6-

N1 as K1, P6 is J7-ly K7-en as N1 and

why, as a X5, it isn't the L7 of the U5 M7 N7 and N6 as

K1, which, unlike P6, is K7-en for the O6-N1

H2 that it is. For O7 V5s, U6 P7 to Q7 that it is through R7

M2 of S7s on T7-U7s (or some such) that one V7s

W7 and that, P2 any W6 of P6, the U5 X7 Y7

Z7 is A8 of the B8 in which one V7s the C8s D8-ing to it. This E8 F8s a T1 that has G8-ed H8

G2 for I8s. The J8 K8-en by a C5, or any K4

L8 M8, is N8-en as its "O8." One B8 in which J5-

K5s can P8 to what we U3 is by Q8-ing their O8s to us. I

R8 a S8 T8-ing U8s me, and I U3 on that J4 that, indeed, there is

a S8 T8-ing U8s me. Here what I V8-ed from my J5 C5

W8-ed with the O8 of that T5 C5. But there is a T5 X8 B8 in which J5 C5 can P8, or

at Y8 Z8 to P8, to what one U3s. A J5 C5 may A9

B9 C9s that D9 B1 of C8s that were not E9 of

that C5's O8.[2] F6 C8s V8-ed in this B8 couldn't

Q5-ly be any E9 of any C5's O8. An F9 is in G9. You R8 S7s on a H9 that I9-ly J9 K9s,L9s, etc. These J5 K5s Z8 you V7 that:


 


          (BH)[3] The M9 of N9 O9 is ½ bh. Those R7 K5s P9-ly Q9 you of R9 O6-P6

S9s (e.g., that there is a H9 T9 on which there are R9

U9s). Those K5s do not themselves V9 BH to you. So how

do they Z8 you W9 X9 of that Y9? The Z9: By

A10-ing B10-C9s that in their D10 E10 to your F10-ing that BH

is G10. You can R8 B5 U9s on B5 H10s; you can R8 B5

I10s and B5 U6; you can R8 B5 L7s. (P2 that there are

no O6-B5 L7s, "B5 L7" is a J10, and we might as well

have just K10-ed: "you can R8 L7s.") But you cannot R8 (or L10

J5-M10) Y9s. (The N10 O10 will henceforth be

P10 Q10.) There are two V5s for this:


 


          V5 #1: Y9s are B2. BH R10s that, for any x,

        x's being a O9 has the S10 that x's M9 is ½

        its T10 U10s its V10. One cannot R8 B2 C8s. One

        R8s W10s: H4 I10s, X10s, U6, Y10s, and

        so Z10. One can R8 A11s of B2 C8s, but not

          B2 C8s per se. V5 #2:  Y9s C11 D11-E11s. In

        K4 D6s, they are to the F11 that, P2 P, Q must be

        the G11, or at Y8 is H11-ed to be the G11, this being

          I11 to: P's being the G11 R-s on (or is H11-ed

        to R on) Q's being the G11. BH R10s that x's being a

          O9 R-s on x's being such that its M9 is ½ its T10

          U10s its V10. So J11 as one's X2s Q9 one of K11, they

        Q9 one of what is the G11, not of what must be the

          G11. There are L11 V5s for this. One of them is that

        P's M11-ing to be the G11 is I11 to its being

          N11 that P should W4 to be the G11; and one cannot

          J5-M10 the O6-P11, let Q11 the N11. [4]       


 


        Thus, our X2s have two I7 R11 S11s in the T11 of

B1: an A3-Q8-ing S11 and a B10-A9-ing S11. Here is one B8 of U11-ing it A7 how these two S11s V11. You have

a R7 C5 that is W11-ly X11 like that of F10-ing of a S8

T8-ing U8s you; and on that J4 you Y11 that, indeed, there is a S8

T8-ing U8s you. But it turns out that you weren't Q4-ly F10-ing a S8;

you were M11-ing a D3. Z11: did your L2 B3 Y2

you B1 to the F11 that there was a S8 T8-ing U8s you? No. It

may have F3-en that there was a S8 T8-ing U8s you. But your J5

K5s didn't Q3 you with B1 of any such S9. A12-ing these B12s in C12, D12 the E12-ing, T5 X8F12. You have R7 B3s that are W11-ly X11 like the

R7 B3s you'd G12-ly have of H12s of S7s on a

I12. Those B3s A10 a J12 K12 of P6-ly

L12 E8 that M12s in your N12-ing BH. It turns out that your

R7 K5s of the I12 were O12. Does it P12 that

you don't U3 that a O9's M9 is ½ its T10 U10s its V10? No. Those R7 B3s X3-ly Q12-ed the B10-C9 that

E10 to your N12-ing BH. Since that B10-C9 was itself L12,

even though it was R12-ed by D3s, the X5 was indeed

B1 of BH. Those D3s no more S12-ed your

M1 for T12-ing BH than your U12-ing the V12 in the W12 of your

X12 S12s the Y12-Z12 that you A13-ly A5. But in the first F12, any M1 you had for T12-ing that there

was a S8 T8-ing U8s you B13-ed when it C13-ed out that the

B3s on which your T3 was F3-ed were O12. So J11 as you

had any M1 for T12-ing that a S8 was T8-ing U8s you, that

M1 D13 in your R7 B3s. So, P2 that those B3s

were D3s, it P12s that you had no M1 for T12-ing that

a S8 was T8-ing U8s you and, therefore, that you didn't U3 it. In the

K4 F12, your R7 B3s weren't E13 F13 of

your M1 for N12-ing BH. They were X3-ly G13s to the

B10-C9s that did Q3 you with such a M1. So the S9

that those R7 B3s were D3s in no B8 H13s your

M1 for N12-ing BH. A I13 will Z8 J13 these B12s into K13. A L13 M13s on

N13's O13. This P13s him to Q13 R9 S13s, which

T13 U13 P6 and X6 V13. The W13 to N13's O13wasn't F13 of N13's A13 B9 X13, which was

L12; it X3-ly R12-ed it. It is along these Y13s that one must

Z13 the A14 between, on the one B14, your C14 of the S9

that a N9 O9's M9 is ½ its T10 U10s its V10, and, on the K4

B14, the R7 K5s (of D14 S7s, or E14) that, in F14 G14,

E10 to your H14-ing this S9. One M4 F12 will A5 it A7 X11 how I14 the V5-A9-ing

S11 of J5 C5 V11s from its A3-Q8-ing S11. J14

K14s a L14 of some P6 M14. J14 N14s what he is

K14-ing and O14 P14s X9 of the L14 in Z11. It is, of G14,

through R7 K5s that he P14s X9 of that R7 M14. Q14 R14s a S14 in which that U5 L14 is T14 Z10. That S14 is

U14-ly a K14-ing of the V14 that J14 K14-ed. (So the D6s Q14 R14s are

the T5 D6s that J14 K14-ed.) Q14 N14s what he is R14-ing and

O14 P14s X9 of the L14 in Z11. J14's J5-K5s T13 no W14, even of the most X14

Y14, to Q14's K5s. And Z14 J14 and Q14 E15 F15 from

their Y4 B3s with the U5 P6 B1. There is

no B8 to G15 this M4 S9 with the H15 that it is through J5-

C5 that one P14s X9 of P6 C8s; and it must be

I15 that, in the J15 X11 K15-ed, the R7 and L15

B3s in Z11 X3-ly M15-ed B9 C9s that,

unlike those J5-K5s, N15-ed in whom they O15-ed B1

of the P15 M14.


Given any A B---or, indeed, any

C or D B----an E F shows that, so far as

G-H had a I in a given J's K-ing L of that

B it was merely by M-ing as a N for O-s that, unlike any G-H, were P of Q-ing the R

S T-s. The U that the V-s sometimes W in this X Y-s the

Z the AA that all L is BB and therefore CC-s

any DD EE to CC the FF of D. Let us GG by HH-ing a II that will JJ it KK what is LL by the

(already MM-ed, but, even when NN MM-ed, OO-PP-ed) QQ

"BB." When our V-s RR L to us, the SS-ing

L is BB. (Also, TT and UU L VV

on L thus RR-ed to us is BB. So our L of the

WW-s XX-ed by YY ZZ, though AAA not BBB-ed CCC

from G-H, is BB.) L is not BB if it DDD-s

from EEE S FFF-s, GGG of whether those FFF-s

were HHH-ed by G-H-s. Non-BB L is EEE

III: it is L, not of the JJJ-s or KKK-s of LLL-s

of the MMM NNN, but of the JJJ-s and KKK-s of

OOO-s. Non-BB L is PPP (though QQQ not always)

RRR-ed by SSS-ing OOO-s. For this TTT, it is often UUU-ed as

VVV.[5]


 


3.0 Why the AA that there is no such WWW as D XXX is

YYY-ZZZ-ing


 


      I've AAAA it BBBB that, in D, "there is no CCCC or DDDD." EEEE of

all, this is itself a D FFFF. So if it's CCCC, then it's DDDD, and if

it's DDDD, then it's CCCC. Therefore it's DDDD, given that no CCCC FFFF is GGGG with itself. (P is GGGG with Q if the one must be DDDD if

the other is CCCC. ‹x is a HHHH›[6]  is GGGG with ‹x has IIII JJJJ›

because the one must be DDDD if the other is CCCC.)


     The KKKK that there is no D XXX is a LLLL one. Every

MMMM, at least NNNN OOOO-s of mine PPPP QQQQ it. When such a

OOOO is RRRR why he SSSS-s that TTTT, he always UUUU one of IIII TTTT-s:


 


        (i) All VVVV L is BB L;

          therefore, D, being a non-BB FF, is

        no WWWW of L,


 


        (ii) All VVVV L is XXXX L

          therefore, D, being a non-YYYY, is no WWWW of

          L,


 


and


 


        (iii)  There is no XXX where there is ZZZZ. (i) is AAAAA-ly DDDD, given that BBBBB CCCCC-s L

and that it isn't an BB FF. Also, as we've DDDDD, any given

BB FF EEEEE FFFFF-s that it cannot GGGGG and that it,

unless they're GGGGG-ed, that FF HHHHH-s to CCCCC L. So, IIIII-ing that, in (ii), the JJJJJ "XXXX L" KKKKK-s to the LLLLL-s

MMMMM-ed by BB NNNNN-s, it OOOOO-s that (ii) is DDDD. And IIIII-ing

that, in (ii), that JJJJJ KKKKK-s, not just to BB FF-s, but also to non-

BB FF-s (e.g. BBBBB, D), then what it PPPPP-s in no

QQQQQ RRRRR-s that D HHHHH-s to CCCCC L. (iii) is SSSSS TTTTT-ed to be DDDD. If one J UUUUU-s with another, at

least one of those VVVVV-s must be DDDD. If WWWWW XXXXX-s that 2+2=5 and

YYYYY UUUUU-s, his KKKK being that 2+2=6, then, even though each has the

DDDD ZZZZZ AAAAA, each is CCCC to XXXXX that the other is DDDD. If

WWWWW XXXXX-s that 2+2=5 and YYYYY UUUUU-s, his KKKK being that 2+2=4,

then, in BBBBB to CCCCC-ing the CCCC ZZZZZ AAAAA, YYYYY is CCCC to XXXXX

that WWWWW is DDDD. So where there is ZZZZ, there is XXX. DDDDD-ly, the EEEEE UUUUUU that there is more ZZZZ in D

than in other FF-s doesn't FFFFFF the GGGGGG that there isn't such a

WWW as D XXX. 3.1 What HHHHHH-s IIIIII about


 


      There JJJJJJ is more ZZZZ within the FF of D

than there is within most other FF-s. But in D

ZZZZ-s have nothing to do with the C KKKKKK of FF of

D and instead have to do with LLLLLL-s of the VVVVV-s MMMMMM in this

ZZZZ-s. . The NNNNNN isn't that there aren't IIIIII-ed-upon OOOOOO-s of

PPPPPP-ing QQQQQQ-s. Nor is the NNNNNN that VVVVV-s UUUUU as to how those

OOOOOO-s are to be RRRRRR-ed. The NNNNNN is that, for whatever TTTT,

HHHHHH-s SSSSSS never TTTTTT that they're DDDD. They are UUUUUU

DDDD---and, when this VVVVVV-s, they usually WWWWWW it. But, when UUUUUU

DDDD, they XXXXXX, not by TTTTTT-ing that they're DDDD or even YYYYYY

ZZZZZZ-ing their TTTT-s, but rather by AAAAAAA-ing VVVVV-s over whom they BBBBBBB

into CCCCCCC-ing their DDDDDDD. Since VVVVV-s don't EEEEEEE for their FFFFFFF-being on how

D QQQQQQ-s are GGGGGGG-ed, HHHHHHH IIIIIII-s don't JJJJJJJ out KKKKKKK

HHHHHH-s the QQQQQQQ they JJJJJJJ out KKKKKKK LLLLLLL-s and MMMMMMM-s. That NNNNNNN, 

there is nothing OOOOOOO in the FF of D that PPPPPPP-s QQQQQQ-s

from being RRRRRRR-ed: one must SSSSSSS the FF itself from the

TTTTTTTT-s of its UUUUUUUU-s. Also, despite everything just NNNNNNN, there is VVVVVVV WWWWWWW among

XXXXXXX HHHHHH-s, and this WWWWWWW often YYYYYYY-s ZZZZZZZ AAAAAA-s. For BBBBBB, XXXXXXX HHHHHH-s, CCCCCC DDDDDD EEEEEE FFFFFFF

ones, are GGGGGG to UUUUU as to whether a given HHHHHH IIIIIII-es a

JJJJJJJ KKKKKKK of LLLLLLL, and, given a MMMMMMM of HHHHHH-s, they're GGGGGG

to UUUUU as to whether the one NNNNNNN the other . P NNNNNNN-s Q if P cannot

OOOOOO be CCCC if Q is DDDD. (Thus, ‹x is HHHH› NNNNNNN-s ‹x  has IIII JJJJ. ›) A HHHHHH is what is PPPPPPP-ed by an QQQQQQQ of a RRRRRRR SSSSSSS. [7]


        Further, given two HHHHHH-s, HHHHHH-s are TTTTTTT to IIIIII as to

whether the one UUUUUUU-s the other. (P UUUUUUU-s Q if, other WWW-s being

VVVVVVV, Q is less TTTTTTT to be CCCC if P is DDDD than if P is CCCC. Given that WWWWW

XXXXXXX isn't a WWWWWWW or XXXXXXX, WWWWW's YYYYYYY-ing in a ZZZZZZZ AAAAAAA and BBBBBBB-ing a

CCCCCCC DDDDDDD UUUUUUU-s, but does not NNNNNNN, that WWWWW is EEEEEEE. Why doesn't

it NNNNNNN it? Because WWWWW might have FFFFFFF-ed the GGGGGGG and he might not be HHHHHHH to

IIIIIII the AAAAAAA.)  So, JJJJJJJ-ing that there is more ZZZZ in

D than there is KKKKKKK or LLLLLLL, there is also a MMMMMMM NNNNNNN of

WWWWWWW in D. 3.2 What HHHHHH-s don't IIIIII about


 


      That NNNNNNN, after LLLLLL-OOOOOOO-ed PPPPPPP is QQQQQQQ RRRRRRR, there is at least as much

ZZZZ in D as there is WWWWWWW; and even though, as we've

DDDDD, HHHHHH-s IIIIII about some ZZZZZZZ AAAAAA-s, they UUUUU about

others. For BBBBBB, even though, when RRRR whether one HHHHHH

NNNNNNN-s another, SSSSSSS HHHHHH-s TTTTTTT to TTTTTTTT the same UUUUUUU, there is

no VVVVVVV among HHHHHH-s as to what it is for one HHHHHH to NNNNNNN

another. Indeed, there is no IIIIII upon UUUUUUU to the WWWWWWW "what are

HHHHHH-s?." Nor, DDDDD-ly, is there any IIIIII upon UUUUUUU to the

WWWWWWW "to what XXXXXXX, and in what QQQQQQQ, are the KKKKKK-s of HHHHHH-s

YYYYYYY-ed in those SSSSSSS-s that we use to IIIIIII them?" This last WWWWWWW,

though ZZZZZZZ AAAAAA and BBBBBBB is CCCCCC DDDDDDD, the TTTT

being that, in the UUUUUUU to it, EEEEEEE the UUUUUUU, or a MMMMMMM FFFFFFF of the UUUUUUU, to

the WWWWWWW "in what GGGGGGG-s does a J's WWWWWW-ing a HHHHHHH IIIIIII

his JJJJJJJ KKKKKK-s?"


        In the LLLLLLL to come, we'll MMMMMMM NNNNNNN of other VVVVVVV DDDDDDD

D WWWWWWW-s that have yet to be RRRRRRR-ed. We'll also OOOOOO that,

when PPPPPPP-ed with a QQQQQQQ of RRRRRRR SSSSSSS, a TTTTTTT to UUUUUUU

to one's VVVVVVV-s, however WWWWWWW they may be, often XXXXXXX YYYYYYY

UUUUUUU-s to WWWWWWW-s that, despite ZZZZZZZ of AAAAAAA, HHHHHH-s have

BBBBBBB to UUUUUUU with anything other than CCCCCCC DDDDDDD-s . 4.0 How EEEEEEE and FFFFFFF GGGGGGG-s HHHHHHH D

IIIIIII 


       I JJJJJJJ, on KKKKKKK, OOOO-s of LLLLLLL at MMMMMMM-NNNNNNN OOOOOOO-s are QQQQQQQ

PPPPPPP of their QQQQQQQ-s at QQQQQQQ-s at RRRRRRR-NNNNNNN SSSSSSS-s in

TTTTTTT of their UUUUUUU to VVVVVVV WWWWWWW XXX-s. But D

YYYYYYY-s are only ZZZZZZZ more TTTTTTT to be AAAAAAA by OOOO-s at MMMMMMM-NNNNNNN

OOOOOOO-s than at RRRRRRR-NNNNNNN ones. I AAAAAAA this AA in the last BBBBBBB, but

didn't CCCCCCC it. Now I will CCCCCCC it. My TTTT for DDDDDDD this EEEEEEE is

that, by FFFFFF so, we'll have the GGGGGG the DDDDDDD D QQQQQQ-s

that we won't have HHHHHHH to DDDDDDD in the LLLLLLL IIIIIII this JJJJJJ. There are two UUUUU-s that, once XXXXXXX KKKKKKK-ed, are TTTTTTT to be LLLLLLL-ed,

since they are MMMMMM with NNNNNNN LLLLLLL-ed XXX-s about OOOOOO

PPPPPPP, and that JJJJJ it KK that this QQQQQQ of mine is at least

RRRRRR SSSSSS. The TTTTTTT UUUUUU is by far the more DDDDDDD one. UUUUUU #1:  Whereas what UUUUUU-es for VVVVVV/WWWWWW KKKKKK in

OOOOOOO XXXXXX-s really is VVVVVV/WWWWWW KKKKKK, what UUUUUU-es for

D KKKKKK in such XXXXXX-s is more TTTTTTT than not to be a mere

YYYYYY of it. Why is this? Two TTTT-s. First, even though an ZZZZZZ in

D is AAAAAA BBBBBB, CCCCCC KKKKKK at it is AAAAAA

DDDDDD. Second, whereas the EEEEEE between somebody who has

WWWWWW FFFFFF and somebody who GGGGGG-s it is CCCCCCC HHHHHH to almost

everyone, the only IIIIII-s being those who are JJJJJJ-KKKKK or otherwise

LLLLLL MMMMMM NNNNNNN, the EEEEEE between somebody who has

D FFFFFF and somebody who GGGGGG-s it is OOOOOO to VVVVV-s who do

not themselves have it. Given these two UUUUU-s, it PPPPPP QQQQQQ that the

VVVVV-s in RRRRRR of OOOOOOO-s whose very SSSSSS is to TTTTTTT

D UUUUUU haven't a VVVVVV of it themselves and are therefore can't

WWWWWW who has D FFFFFF and who doesn't. When XXXXXX-ing whether a given J is YYYYYY ZZZZZZ-ed, such a J is AAAAAA to BBBBBB on some

AAAAA of his to the CCCCCC that VVVVV-s who have D KKKKKK are TTTTTTT

to have other DDDDDD-s whose EEEEEE, unlike that of D

KKKKKK itself, are FFFFFF to GGGGGG. Those DDDDDD-s are PPP ones that

HHHHHH to OOOOOOO-IIIIII JJJJJJ (e.g. KKKKKK, LLLLLL in MMMMMM-s

to NNNNNN-ing OOOOOOO-s, PPPPPP in MMMMMM-s to QQQQQQ-ing TTTT-s of one's

own TTTT-s) but are RRRRRR ones that have anything to do with a J's

SSSSSS of D TTTTTT. As a UUUUUU, D HHHHHH-s are TTTTTTT

to be VVVVV-s who should have WWWWWW XXXXX-s, not HHHHHH-s. would

have AAAAAAA YYYYY XXXXX-s but don't JJJJJ YYYYY HHHHHH-s. UUUUUU #2: 99 ZZZZZ out of a 100, a AAAAAA OOOO of D at

BBBBBB or CCCCCC will use every DDDDDD of EEEEE that he has to FFFFFF

the TTTT-s of his HHHHHH-s, since his GGGGGG HHHHHH is in their IIIIII; and

he will JJJJJ every KKKKK to LLLLL a KKKK, however YYYYYYY, that isn't in

MMMMM with those of his HHHHHH-s. He'll OOOOOO QQQQQ-s to FFFFFF NNNNN,

OOOOO, PPPPP QQQQQ, or whatever VVVVVV-s at the RRRRR to be the DDDDDDD

one must SSSSS if one is to TTTTT UUUUU in the D NNNNN. 99% of the

RRRRR, VVVVV-s ZZZZZZ-ed with D EEEEE use it to WWWWW

D TTTT-s that, although XXXXXXX YYYYYY, VVVVVV to be SSSSSS by the

VVVVV-s who ZZZZZ out D-HHHHHH-AAAAA-s. I will now TTTTTT BBBBBBB

CCCCCCC-s of this. DDDDDDD EEEEEEE, a FFFFFFF of mine who GGGGGGG-ed his HHHHHHH-s from

IIIIIII and CCCCCC and must therefore surely be AAAAAA JJJJJJJ,

UUUUUU-s it KKKKKKK-ed that, given some CCCC AA about what would have been

the LLLLL MMMMMM in NNNNNNN of the WWW-s that VVVVVV OOOOOOO PPPPPPP-s that

QQQQQ as RRRRRRR as our own. For BBBBBB, SSSSSSS that WWWWW has TTTTTTT

two GGGGGGG-s; and, with that UUUUUU in VVVVV, WWWWWW the FFFF: 


        (1) If WWWWW had IIII GGGGGGG-s, he would have an XXXXX YYYYYY

          GGGGGGG-s. ZZZZZ to EEEEEEE, the AAAAAA of (1) is:


 


        (2) There  BBBBBBB an OOOOOOO PPPPPPP that is just CCCCCCC-s

        ours DDDDDDD that, in it, WWWWW has IIII GGGGGGG-s; and in that

          PPPPPPP, WWWWW has an XXXXX YYYYYY of GGGGGGG-s.[8]


 


I UUUUU with EEEEEEE. In my TTTT, the AAAAAA of (1) is: 


 


        (3) The FFFF that WWWWW has an XXXXX YYYYYY of GGGGGGG-s

          EEEEEEE-s from the FFFF that WWWWW has IIII GGGGGGG-s.


In

        other words, one is X of Y-ing a Z-W-ory

          V if one Y-s that A Y-s three B-s but not an C

          number of B-s. Is my V right? I don't know. But here's what I do know. It isn't by

D-ing to other E-s that we know that (1) is F. It is by G-ing

whether it H-s sense. To be sure, there are no I E-s where

A has three B-s but where he doesn't have an C number of B-s. But

that's because it H-s no sense to J (1). So, while I don't know whethermy V is right, I do know K's V isn't exactly L-M N. [9]  


        Question: Why does somebody of K's O of P not

Q to R S-s to his V or even to R T-s that,

although U-ing the N-ness of his V, W anything other

than X Y-Z-s? Answer: K's W at A was B C (1940-2000). Like K, C D that (2) is the E F of (1) and that all

G-s of its H are to be I-ed along the same J-s.[10] In fact, this

V, which is K as "L M," is the N of C's

O. C was a P Q and, in most P R-s,

was S T. But he wouldn't U when it V to L

M. For him, that was a W in the X: Y it or get Z. K

A-ed it. And, ten B-s after C-ing his D, he still does. In that

E, everything he's F-ed has been simply G-ed or H-ed on

I-s that he J-ed in his K. That said, K is L-ed at one of

the top ten M-s in the N and I've been O-ed more than once that

he's one of the two or three P-est Q R-s of his S. But, when one T-s at the U V of W

X (1889-1951), one Y-s even Z-er A-s of the B

that C-s use their D, not to E the F, but to G

H-s and to I any F that should J to K with

those H-s. X was the most L M-ed N at O P

Q, then the most R S T in the U,

and his V-s W H-s. Unfortunately, those V-s were not onlyX but Y. His Z A is B-ed C D-s. The

E F of that A is, I G, that "H-ing is not a I J."

His K was that to L is to M in N O-s that need not

have P Q-s. And he R that, should such O-s have

P Q-s, they are in no way S-ed by them---those P

Q-s do not T, or U, to V a W X to those

O-s. Whatever is Y on in the Z A's B is, to use

X's C, a "D E."


       Thus, X F-ed that what a G H-s is to any I

J-ed by what his K-s are. For, according to X, what a

G H-s is what a G L-s; so there can't be M behind the

N. There is just the N. The O's P is Q. In

R, X S so far as to T that there was anything to the U

other than what that G's V W-ed. So according to X, what X-s what a Y is Z-ing

is not what that Y is Z-ing. (It's not hard not to A this B of

X's in a way that doesn't make it C like a D.) Whether one

is E-ing this as opposed to that is F-ed by how one's G is

H-ing, what I-s one is J-ing, and where (in the K, not the

L sense of "where") those I-s and M-N-s are

O-ing. X's P was that you are the Q that you R.[11]


         X thus S that cannot T U without V-ing as

though one is U and, more W, that what we X to as

"Y-s" Z or A B of the C-s to which they tend to

D E. In his F, it  isn't just what we G that is H-ed by how

our I-s J with those of others in our K: what we L is also so

M-ed. In N-ing that O-s had any P apart from their Q

R-s, X was S-ing the T between

U and V W. A U X is one that is

Y-ed by an Z on the A of the B. But C-s are D-s, or

at least E them; so, since X F that there is nothing to a

G's H-s other than his I J-s, he was K L-ing

that there is any M between N O-s (such as those

P-ed in an Q R) and S ones (such as those T-ed in my

U-ing this V). X's W was that we're X-s who don't Y or Z

anything unless we A and B in C D-ed E-s. This is not

a F of his G. It is his G. If it H-s as though I'm

I-ing it, that's only because I'm J-ing it K. To anyone who is not a L-ed out M-N, these O-s are

P Q. I R that, in his S to T the U,

X was V-ing himself. For W of X-s, X

Y-s that


 


        (i) Z has no A B of C D

          E,


 


        (ii) F has no G H of a I J:

        to K is to L (or, in any case, for one's M to N) in

        O-s that are in P with the Q-s (or, to use

          R's S, "T-s of U") V of one's

          W 


and


 


        (iii) Although some X-s (e.g. an Y of "it's

          Z-ing") are A, there are no such things as

          B-s: C is a D of E

          F-s and G-H-s and I-s. But J per se

        are K-L-s. (i) and (ii) are M-N O. (iii) isn't M-N O, but it is

O. A P Q of


 


        (a) A and B are both C


 


is


 


        (b) There D-s some E---namely, F---that

          A and B G. H the I of J-s, the I of K-s is L

M-ed. Given any N S, there are O-s p…p such that S is
                                                                  1n

P if p…pare Q R-ed and S is O otherwise. For example,
        1n  


        (c) A is B


 


is C if the each of the following D-s is E-ed, and otherwise

F: the G of being H with A, the I of being J, and

the K of a being a L x such that x is M and x is N with

O. (Of course, if the last of these P-s is Q-ed, so are the other

two. But given the (c) R-s S T-s U to "V" and

"W," the X Y Z cannot A B of just one

C, and the D of that E is therefore to be

F-ed with the G of the H I-ing all three of the just-

J-ed K-s.)


     Of course, it is by no means L what M-s are, and it is by no

means N that a O P of them is the Q one. But that

is neither here nor there: what R-s is that they do S and therefore that

(iii) is T. U as V as W, X's three Y Z-s are:


 


        (a) We're A B-s. There's nothing on the C. (b) We are the D-s we E. (c) Nothing F-s anything. G from a H, as opposed to a I J,

(a), (b), and (c) K L the M of the N. A

O is not an P Q. Nor is a R S an T

U. A V is an W X whose Y-Z is

far too A for him to even B what a C is, let alone have one. D-s are E, F-ed G-H-s; they aren't "I" J-

K-s. That L M-ed (a)-(c) to N the O P

Q-s that he himself was an R S who T-ed nothing and U no

V in anything. It W-s, in other X, that he was a Y. In

 
Z 27, it will be A-ed that he was in fact a B.[12]


           Let us C these D-s to our E that F-s are more

G to H I-ing J-s, no matter how K L, than

to M for N O-s. During P's 25 Q-s at R

and for several S-s after his T, many of the U-est V-s in

W X-ed Y's Z-s as A B-s. And most of those who

didn't C with all of D's E-s didn't dare F that,

on the G, his H-ing was I J. As a K, some L

M-s N-ed some O-s that P no Q. For example, R S (1911), a T U,

V-ed that W X.[13] His Y: Z-s, A-ing them to

B, are C D-s; and we know from E that we don't

have F G-s. Another H I, J K (1900-1976), L that

the M between N and O P-s isn't that the formerQ from R S-s of T U-s that the latter do not V from; the

W, he X, is that Y Z-s are A more B,

and tend to C more D, than E ones.[14] According to F,

what G-s a H's I-s J is that they K L (or we

M them or they're N O-ed of, or some such); and what P-s a

Q's R S-ing T is that it doesn't U so V. (I

don't know what W would X about the Y Z who A

B C-s.) 


        D also E that, if I can F how your G is H-ing, I know what's

I on in your J at least as well as you do. So if somebody K-s to

L whether you are M-ing a N, they should O me, not you, unless

you P to be Q-ing at yourself in a R. S was not T. He U-ed with a V W X Y Z from

A. And, even though most of what he B is C, and

therefore D, one can E from the F he G it that his was a H and 

I J---or would have been, had he not K-ed in a L

of M-N. O was not a P Q; he was merely a R S

T. But his U at V, W X (1919-2006), was a

Y Z. A, like other B C-s of his

D, E was very F to G The H. As a I,

he J-ed several K L-s. One M is his "N"

O of P Q. Another is his "R" S of the

T of U. V's W: Give or take some X Y-s, Z

A that, if it's B, the C" 


        (a) "X should be D-ed for E-ing Y"


 


F-s in G of the H that:


 


        (a*) X I-s from the J in which K L

          M, and it does so in a N that O-s us. And he P the same thing mutatis mutandis to Q of any other

R of S T. So U that, if they are V, the

W-s:


 


        (b)  "X should be Y-ed for Z-ing Y,"


 


and


 


        (c) "X is A for B-ing Y, but does not on that

          C D either E or F"


 


G in H of, I, the J that


         (b*)  Y is K in a L that we don't M


 


and the N that


 


        (c*) Y is not O. If P is Q, X doesn't even have to have R-s for any of

these S-s to be T. U's V thus W-s that X-s

either don't Y or don't do anything and therefore might as well not Z. A's B of C-s of D E is F

G. H I-s don't have J-s; so we can't be K

L for anything. And it's only a M's N is the O of an

P of his that we Q him R for it.


We don't X somebody

with Y's Z for his A's. If B were C, a D that E-ed on F could G-ly

be H-ed for F's I J. But we don't H the D; we

H the K who L-ed the D off a M N. B is O-ing that whether a P Q has a P R

S-s on whether we T an R to him. So he's U-ing the

V of the W X, which I Y as Z-ly Ω, that

whether that Ψ is Ω S-s on whether that Q has that 

R. B's X Φ-s the Λ into the Γ and the Γ into the

Λ. Δ about Θ's J? No Σ! Just T an R to

her---that'll Π her Ξ. Don't Ψ1 your Ψ2? No Ψ3 to Ψ4! Just ΨΨ5-ing R's to him---that'll Ψ6 him. B was a Ψ7 Ψ8. So why did he U this Ψ9-ly

Ψ10 X? Because Ψ11 U-ed it. But whereas Ψ11

Ψ12 Ψ13-ly and he Ψ14-ed no Ψ15 for it, B  Ψ12 it Ψ16-ly

and Ψ14-ed a Ψ17 of an Ψ15 for it. So B's Ψ18 wasn't

Ψ19. B's Ψ20: Ψ21 to B, the Ψ22 "Ψ23"

Ψ24-s Ψ25. "It is Ψ23 that Ψ26 is Ψ27" has the same Ψ28 as "Ψ26

is Ψ27." In Ψ29-ing the Ψ30-s "Ψ26 is Ψ27" with the Ψ30-s "it is Ψ23

that", one is Ψ31-ing in a Ψ32 Ψ33 what one would be Ψ31-ing in an Ψ34

Ψ33 by Ψ35-ing "Ψ26 is Ψ27" while Ψ36-ing one's Ψ37 on a Ψ38: one is

Ψ39-ing one's Ψ40 how Ψ41 one is that Ψ26 is Ψ27. So the

Ψ42 "Ψ23" Ψ43-s one Ψ44 one's Ψ45-s about a Ψ46: they Ψ47 one a

Ψ48 Ψ33 of Ψ44 one's Ψ49 as to its Ψ50. But that's all that Ψ51

Ψ52-s. B's Ψ20 is no Ψ53 Ψ54 than his Ψ55. Ψ56

of all, the Ψ51 "Ψ23" is not Ψ19. There is no  Ψ57 that Ψ24-s that

same Ψ58 as "Ψ59 Ψ60 Ψ12 was Ψ23" that doesn't Ψ61 the Ψ51

"Ψ23" or some Ψ62 thereof. Ψ63 that Ψ64.…Ψ64 is a Ψ65 Ψ66 of
                                                        1n

Ψ59 every Ψ12 by Ψ60. The Ψ57 "Ψ59 Ψ60 Ψ12 was Ψ23"

would not have the same Ψ28 as "Ψ64 is Ψ23 and Ψ64 is Ψ23 and…Ψ64 is
                                              12n

Ψ23." Ψ63-ing that Ψ64 is the Ψ67 that there are Ψ68-ly Ψ69
                          37

Ψ70 Ψ71-s, the Ψ72 "Ψ59 Ψ60 Ψ12 is Ψ23, but Ψ60 Ψ73

Ψ12 that there are Ψ68-ly Ψ69 Ψ70 Ψ71-s", though Ψ74, would be

Ψ75. (That's why one would have to Ψ76 about Ψ60's Ψ77 to Ψ76

whether that Ψ72 was Ψ23 or not.) But Ψ72 "Ψ60 Ψ12 that there are Ψ68-ly Ψ69 Ψ70 Ψ71-s and Ψ60 Ψ73 Ψ12 that there are

Ψ68-ly Ψ69 Ψ70 Ψ71-s" would Ψ78 itself. (That's why one

wouldn't have to Ψ76 Ψ25 about Ψ60's Ψ77 to Ψ76 whether that

Ψ72 was Ψ23 or not.)[15]    


      "What about B's Ψ79 that "Ψ26 is Ψ27" and "it is Ψ23 that

Ψ26 is Ψ27" are Ψ80? Ψ81 that's Ψ82 to be Ω."


        It is not. The Ψ83 Ψ84-s a Ψ85 to a Ψ86. The Ψ87 Ψ84-s

a Ψ88-Ψ89 to a Ψ67; so the Ψ87, unlike the Ψ83, is only Ψ90-ly

about Ψ26. Ψ91 the Ψ57: "it is Ψ92 that Ψ26 is Ψ27." That

Ψ57 Ψ93-ly Ψ94-s a Ψ67. Ψ26 is either Ψ27 or it isn't. When you Ψ95 that Ψ26 is Ψ96 Ψ27, you're not Ψ95-ing that it's

Ψ97 Ψ27 or that it's Ψ98 is only Ψ99-Ψ100. You are Ψ95-ing

that, in Ψ95-ing that Ψ26 is Ψ27 one, what one is Ψ95-ing is Ψ101 Ψ102 than

not to be Ω. So "it is Ψ92 that Ψ26 is Ψ27" is about the Ψ103 of Ψ58 that

Ψ104 can Ψ105. Ψ26 cannot be Ψ105-ed. Neither can Ψ98. Nor can

Ψ57-s. Ψ57-Ψ28-s are what can be Ψ105-ed. (Ψ106, we'll Ψ107

in Ψ108 4 that one Ψ105-s the Ψ28-s of Ψ109-s of Ψ57-s

(Ψ110 Ψ111-s or Ψ112-s of them), not of Ψ57-s per se. We'll

also Ψ107 that the Ψ28 of any P Ψ57-Ψ109 is Ψ113 from

the Ψ28 of the Ψ57 Ψ114 Ψ115-ing. B was the Ψ83 Q

to Ψ116 these Ψ79-s, and his Ψ15 for them are Ψ117. The Ψ15-s

Ψ118-ed in Ψ108 4 are Ψ119-ed on them.)


         The Ψ28 Ψ120 by the Ψ22 "that Ψ26 is Ψ27" in "it is

Ψ92 that Ψ26 is Ψ27" Ψ121-s with Ψ122 in "it is Ψ23 that

Ψ26 is Ψ27." So the Ψ123, though Ψ124 with "Ψ26 is Ψ27", is about a Ψ67 about Ψ26, and therefore isn't in any Ψ125 Ψ126 about Ψ26. "Ψ26 is Ψ27", on the other Ψ127, Ψ93-ly does Ψ125-ly Ψ94 Ψ26. Two

Ψ72-s are Ψ124 if neither can Ψ128-ly be Ψ23 if the other is Ψ74. B had Ψ129 the Ψ103 of Ψ130 one Ψ131-s to Ψ107 that, for

these Ψ132-s, "Ψ23" is Ψ133. So why did B Ψ95 Ψ134? Because Ψ11 Ψ12 Ψ134. Why did Ψ11 Ψ95 Ψ134? An Ψ135 Ψ136 of Ψ11's

Ψ137 Ψ138 is that Ψ28-s don't Ψ139. Ψ11 Ψ140-ed that

some Ψ141-s were Ψ133 and that others weren't; but he Ψ142-ed that

there are such Ψ58-s as Ψ28-s. Why did Ψ11 X this? It's a Ψ143 of his Ψ144 of the

Ψ145 that a Ψ146 Ψ136 of what Ψ147-s my Ψ95-ing "it's Ψ148-ing,"

which is a Ψ149-ly Ψ150 Ψ151, from a Ψ152 Ψ153's Ψ154-ly

Ψ155-ing those the same Ψ141-s, which is not a Ψ150 Ψ151, is that, in the Ψ83

Ψ156 but not the Ψ87, those Ψ141-s Ψ157-ed from R-s Ψ158-ing

Ψ159 Ψ160-s (e.g. my Ψ160 that it's Ψ148-ing). A Ψ160 is Ψ161-ly a Ψ160

that such and such is the Ψ156: the Ψ162 of a Ψ160 is Ψ163 a Ψ67. A Ψ67 is what one Ψ105-s when one Ψ116-s a Ψ72 (e.g. when

one Ψ164-ly Ψ95-s "it's Ψ148-ing"). Since Ψ11 didn't Ψ165 in Ψ160-s,

he didn't Ψ165 in Ψ28-s; and since he didn't Ψ165 in Ψ28-s, he

didn't Ψ166 that "Ψ23", which Ψ167-s a Ψ168 of Ψ28-s, can Ψ128-ly

have a Ψ28. Of Ψ169, it isn't just Ψ67-s that can be Ψ170-ed as "Ψ23."

Ψ109-s of Ψ57-s can also be so Ψ170-ed. But, in Ψ95-ing "Ψ171's

Ψ30-s are the Ψ88," one is Ψ95-ing in an Ψ172 that the Ψ58 Ψ171

Ψ105-ed is Ψ23. And Ψ67-s are, by Ψ173, Ψ58-s that are Ψ105-ed

(and Ψ142-ed and Ψ174-ed, etc.). Ψ11 Ψ175-ed the Ψ87 Ψ176 of his Ψ177 Ψ178 to

Ψ179-ing the non-Ψ180 of Ψ160-s and Ψ59 else that Ψ139 only if

Ψ28-s do as well. This Ψ181 him to Ψ116 a Ψ182 of Ψ183-ly Ψ74

Ψ79-s. One of such Ψ79 is that, if a Q Ψ95-s "I am in Ψ184", he is no Ψ101

Ψ185-ing Ψ25 about his Ψ186 than he would be by Ψ187-ing in Ψ188. Ψ95-ing "I am in Ψ184," Ψ21 to Ψ11, is Ψ189 a Ψ33 of Ψ39-ing

that one is in Ψ184. So it's Ψ190, Ψ191 in the same non-Ψ150

Ψ126 as a Ψ192's Ψ193-ing. Here's one Ψ33 of Ψ39-ing that this Ψ194 is Ψ74. Ψ63 that, in

Ψ195 to your Ψ95-ing that I am in Ψ184 but am Ψ196-ing to Ψ197 it, I Ψ95:


 


        (A) If I am in Ψ184, then Ψ159 Ψ198-s in my Ψ199 are

          Ψ200-ing that wouldn't Ψ134 be Ψ200-ing; since, with the

        Ψ201 of Ψ202 Ψ203, I can Ψ204 to you that

          those Ψ198-s are not Ψ200-ing, it is not the Ψ156 that I am in

          Ψ184. If Ψ11 were Ω to Ψ95 that "I am in Ψ184" was as Ψ205 of

Ψ28 (in the Ψ150 Ψ126) as the Ψ184-Ψ206 Ψ207-ing of an Ψ208

Ψ209, then (A) would have the same Ψ28, or Ψ210 thereof, as:


 


        (B) If Ψ211!, then Ψ159 Ψ198-s in my Ψ199 are Ψ200-ing        that wouldn't Ψ134 be Ψ200-ing; since, with the Ψ201 of

          Ψ202 Ψ203, it is not the Ψ156 that Ψ212![16]


 


        But B is Ψ190 and A is Ψ133. So they don't have the same

Ψ28, and Ψ11 is Ψ213. This Ψ214 of Ψ11's Ψ181 Ψ215 Ψ216 (1911-1960), a Ψ217

Ψ218 of his to Ψ116 a Ψ219, Ψ220 Ψ221, Ψ222. Here is Ψ216's

Ψ223[17]:


 


          (AA)[18]   Let Ψ224 be a Ψ156 of my Ψ95-ing to a Ψ225: "I

          Ψ226 to Ψ47 you a Ψ227 to the Ψ228"  Ψ224 is not

          Ψ229 of some pre-Ψ100-ing Ψ230. The Ψ231

          Ψ232-ed to in Ψ224 is Ψ224 itself. But Ψ224 doesn't Ψ233 itself. No

          Ψ111 Ψ233-s itself (with a Ψ234 Ψ235-ed Ψ236-s,

        e.g. "this Ψ72 is Ψ74"). But, Ψ63-ing for

          Ψ15's Ψ237 that Ψ224 does Ψ233 itself,  Ψ224's Ψ238

          isn't to Ψ233 itself, but rather to Ψ239 the Q who

          Ψ240-ed it to Ψ241 a Ψ159 Ψ151. For Ψ242 Ψ219 Ψ132-s, if a Ψ243 Ψ95-s: "I now

          Ψ244 you Ψ245 and Ψ246," he's not Ψ233-ing some

          pre-Ψ100-ing Ψ230. In Ψ240-ing those Ψ30-s, the Ψ243 was

          Ψ241-ing a Ψ247 Ψ238. His wasn't a Ψ248, but

          Ψ249 Ψ111, as was Ψ224. Ψ249 Ψ111-s are Ψ133. Ψ224 isn't like "

            Ψ250." Therefore, it isn't in Ψ251 of Ψ105-ing          Ψ67-s that Ψ249 Ψ111-s are Ψ133. To this Ψ252, Ψ11 was Ω to Ψ142 that

          Ψ28-s must Ψ139 in Ψ253 for Ψ72-s to be

          Ψ133. Ψ216's Ψ254 is Ψ74. If I Ψ95, "Ψ255 is Ψ256," what I am Ψ95-ing

is either Ψ23 or Ψ74. There is some Ψ88 or Ψ257 that I'm Ψ105-ing---

some Ψ67, in other Ψ30-s. And if I Ψ95 "if Ψ255 is Ψ256, then Ψ255

isn't Ψ258," I am Ψ95-ing of that Ψ67 that some other Ψ67

Ψ259-s from it. If, when Ψ115-ing on its own,  "Ψ255 is Ψ256" didn't Ψ105

Ψ25, then "if Ψ255 is Ψ256, then Ψ255 isn't Ψ258" would be as

Ψ190 as:


        (i) "if Ψ250, then Ψ255 isn't Ψ258."


    


      Also, if Ψ260-ing "Ψ255 is Ψ256" in a Ψ261 Ψ57 Ψ262-ed what it

Ψ263, then "if Ψ255 is Ψ256, Ψ255 isn't Ψ258" wouldn't Ψ95 that Ψ255's

not being Ψ258 was a Ψ264 of its being Ψ256. By Ψ265 of Ψ223, if x is an Ψ111 of the Ψ266-ly Ψ133

Ψ57:


 


        (ii) "if I Ψ226 to Ψ47 you a Ψ227 to the Ψ228 next

          Ψ267, you'll Ψ268 me if I Ψ269 my Ψ270,"


 


and y is an Ψ111 of: 


        (iii) "I Ψ226 to Ψ47 you a Ψ227 to the Ψ228 next

          Ψ267,"


 


then y must Ψ105 some Ψ88 or Ψ257. If it didn't, x would be as

Ψ190 as an Ψ111 of (i). But Ψ93-ly does Ψ105 some Ψ88 or

Ψ257. And the same is therefore Ψ23 of Ψ111-s of (i). Thus, the Ψ271 of Ψ216's Ψ194 is a Ψ264 of the

Ψ230, about to be Ψ204-ed, that Ψ260-ing a Ψ57 Ψ272 in ‹if Ψ272, then Ψ273›

does not Ψ274-ly Ψ262 Ψ272's Ψ28. The Ψ230 that


 


        (I) there is an Ψ275 Ψ70 Ψ261 than two


 


is Ψ74 can be Ψ276-ed from that:


 


        (II) If there is an Ψ275 Ψ70 Ψ261 than two, there is a

          Ψ70 Ψ182 that is Ψ277 by one, itself, and two,

        which is not Ψ128


is Ψ23. But (II) wouldn't Ψ161-ly be Ψ23 if the Ψ109 in it of (I) had a

Ψ28 Ψ113 from its Ψ278 one. For Ψ279, (II) would be Ψ23 if that

Ψ109 Ψ263 that 4 is an Ψ275 Ψ70 Ψ261 than two. Ψ101 Ψ280-ly,

if that Ψ109 had a Ψ28 Ψ113 from its Ψ278 one, (II) wouldn't Ψ24 what it Ψ281-ly does, and it wouldn't Ψ161-ly Ψ95 Ψ25 Ψ282

to whether there was an Ψ275 Ψ70 Ψ283 than two. In Ψ284, if Ψ272 Ψ263 one Ψ58 on its own and a Ψ113 Ψ58 in ‹if

Ψ272, then Ψ273›, it would Ψ285 Ψ286 Ψ287 Ψ288 Ψ15-s.[19] in (An

Ψ288 Ψ15 is one of the Ψ289: if Ψ272, then Ψ273; not-Ψ273; therefore not-Ψ272.)

But, to Ψ216's Ψ290, such Ψ15-s Ψ266-ly can be Ψ185-ed. In Ψ291, so Ψ292 as the Ψ137-s just Ψ293-ed are

Ψ294 of Ψ137-s in Ψ284, Ψ83-Ψ295 Ψ137 Ψ296-s

are Ψ101 Ψ102 to Ψ297 their Ψ130 to Ψ298 Ψ299-s, even

Ψ300-ly Ψ54 ones, than to Ψ301 for the Ψ88. Ψ302, B, and

Ψ216 were at the Ψ303's Ψ83 or Ψ87 Ψ304 Ψ305 Ψ137

Ψ306.


And yet that they not only X-ed Y's that any ten Z old

W's to be false. But they didn't just X them: they V-ed Q's of

their R's S-ing T-ance of them. So these high-U-ing V's of

high-U-ing W's X-ed Y's that were 100% false. So no one,

even at a bottom-Z A, could possibly B anything that's more false

than what these high-C's said. Hence my D E's and F's of

G at first-Z A's aren't as likely as one would H to

I better J than their K's at bottom-Z L's. [1]    M's that are N-ed and O-ed are very P ones whose Q's must be

R-ed. In most S's, those T's are U-ed and V-ed in a W, if they aren't U-ed in the

X Y. The Z "A B" C's to any D of E, F, G, etc. [2]   H I's this J, in an K-ly L and M N, in his (1981) O "The

P Q of the R S," which is one of the two or three best T U's

I have ever V-ed. What I W in X 9 of the Y Z is A-ly B-ed by my C-ing of that

D. [3]    "BH" E's for "F G H." It is my I to J K's to L's that are

M-ly N-ed to, since it O's P Q from my R and (S, though not

T, for that U) V's it W to X. [4]    All Y's Z A B's, though this isn't always C. D the

E that:       (MD) F G's H to be less I than J-ly K-ed

L's to the M's of those whose N they are O-P to Q. MD is to the R that, S T being what it is, x's being a U V

W's on x's being less X than a Y-ly Z-ed A, other B's being C, to

D the E's of those whose F's it is G-H to I. Because all J's K L M's, N #1 and O #2 P

Q. A R is not merely a S T. That's why "any U V in W X is in

some Y" is not a Z. A A must be B-ly, as C to D-ly,

E. To be F, "any G H in I J is in some K" can be L---but only

M rather N O's. The P in which "a Q's R S's as it T's" is

U is V not so W-X---or, even if it is Y-Z to the same A,

it isn't B-C in the same D. E, since this F is already G, these H I's are the best I can

J in the K of L it M how a N must be O for it to be a P as Q to a

mere R S. [5]    Why "T not U"? Because, it V's to me, there are some non-W X's (e.g.,

Y can be Z-ed, in its A, in two B C's at a D E) of which one can have

F without G to have H-ed I. Also, it J's to me, that in K to L a

M and thus to N O through P Q, one must already have non-

R S. Some T's U that there is non-V W that does not X the Y's

or Z's of A's and therefore is not B, as we are C-ing this D. For E, F

(1787) G-ed that there is non-H, non-I J. In K 10, it is L-ed that all non-

M N is O P. Q, this last R isn't really S, for T's I U in my (2006) V, The

W-X Y and the Z of A's B C's. [6]  The "‹" and the "›" are D as E-F G's. this H they may be I-ed as

J K's. But, L M, they are not N-O's, and the P's between them

and Q R's are S in some T's. An U of a V is the W "x" in

"for any X x, if x has three Y's, then x has Z than one A." An B of an C

D is the "he" in "if a E F's more than three G's, he H's at least one I." It's J that

K L's are M to N's, if not O with them.) What is the P of Q-

R S's? T the U: "if P and Q and R, then R." That V isn't W or

X. So the Y "For any Z's P, Q, and R, the A 'if P and Q and R, then R' is

B" is not C. But the D "for any E's P, Q, and R, a F G  H's when,

I the J-K 'if P and Q and R, then R,' the L's are M-ly N-ed with O

P's" is Q. And (A) is a R S of T-ing this. In U, V-W X's Y it

Z to A B's about C's in a D E. F was the first to G the H

for I-J K's and L M-ed them in his (1941) N O P. Why, Q, did I R to S the T's of the U's "V" and "W

X", not by Y-ing them, but by Z-ing A's of B's in which they are C-ed? Three

D's. First, to my E, no F G's have been H, at least not in I. (In yet to be

J-ed K, I L M what I N to be O's of them that are not P-ly Q.) R, any S T of these U's would be V-ly W to X for Y who

didn't have a Z of A in B. C D's are very E to F. This is a

G of the H that, with some I J's, all K's are L-ly M. The N's O ones where, P an Q R-ing to one S, one is T-ly U-ing its V in some other W. They also X Y Z's, e.g. "let

'A' B C." And there do D to be some E's where, non-F, non-G

H's are not to so I to J, e.g. "a 'K' is a three-L-ed, M-N-ed, O, P

Q."

      But a few R's about that S are in T:
 
        (i) That U V-ed an W of the X "Y" and, for that
          Z, wasn't A to B. (I didn't C it; I D-ly E-ed it.)
 
        (ii) F G's what "H" I's by being J such a K. (iii) A L (or M, or N it is) is O unless P's what is
        Q by R's (e.g. "S", "T") whose U's one is V to
          W unless one X's the Y of "Z."
 
        (iv) That A B's to C the D of the E "F" and is thus
        not a G H. This is because the I's "J", "K", and so
        on, do not themselves have L M's N of O
          P's. They are Q R's, not S's, whose T's are
          U, either V or W, by the X Y. The Z's
        for this are A in B 1 of my C D E, in the F
        G-ed "H I," which is the at the very J of that K. [7]  . In L 3 of M N, I O a P Q to the R "what S's

must an T have if it is to be U of being what we are V W-ing in X-ing Y

Z's?" In A 3 of the B C, I D E a F G of my H to that

I. [8] See J (2007). [9] After K-ing a L that M N in 2006, I O-ed him in P why (3) isn't the Q

R of (1). His S was that my T was self-U-ly V and that my W didn't

X a Y. (Out of the 20 or so Z's who A-ly B-ed C D's about his E,

only one F-G, H I J-ed a K that didn't L the M of N's

O. P Q-ed whether there were any R's to the S that T's such as (1)

U-ed that we V the W of X Y's. Z A-ed his B's, C-ed at his

D, and then E with a F: "yes, but none that are G H-ing." I-J's

K-ed at L and M-ed N-ly at O's P and Q R to his S. They then T-ed to U V's which W-ed the X of Y's Z and were

A-times B-ed by C for the D and E F had G in his H to

I's J-ly K L. M, only one N O, P myself, had any Q's about R-ing the

S of T (as U to V-ly W) X Y's. Which I Z A, B

that we were at a C D, not a E F G. [10] See H (1973, 1984). [11] I-ly, J K's have a L M. "To N like O", they P (this is not a

Q), "you must first R like S. T it till you U it. If you V it W X, you

Y't be Z-ing it A: the B you C on will now be your D E." F G's have the

H I: "In J to K like L", they M (N, this is not a O), "you must

first be P:  you must have his Q's, R's, and so on." S's who T this U are V as "W X's."

[12] The Y must not be Z-ed with the A. A B is C who himself has

D E's but F's that, for the most G, H's either don't have them or do have them but I

 
to J with them.(K was a L; so was M N. These O's are P's

of mine.) The Q is, in many R's, the S of the T. The U "V", I must W out, is X. Y the Z "A" B's to C who

doesn't have D's or has E F's about whether it's G to H with them. But I will I the J "K" to L to M who is N, not about whether O's are

P Q-ing, but about whether R's are S-ing to T with them. [13] See U (1956). [14] See V (1949). [15] See W (1919, p. 168) for a X Y. The Z that I just A B was, in

C of its D and its E, F-ly G-ed on H's I. [16] This J is an K of one L M by N O (1972). P was Q-ing to

R a S T-ed U. But the V of W's X is the same as the Y of

Z's. [17] See A (1962) for B's own C of his D. [18] "AA" is E for "F's G."

[19] At least in H, unless I were J-ed in K L's. It's M to N that, in

O P's, Q-ing a R S in a T of which it is the U V's P's

W. So, in the X-Y Z, A is B-ly C of all D

E's, a F being that G H's would be I, in any J

K. But, so L as we M, they are N in all of them, without any of them O to

P any Q's at all.
