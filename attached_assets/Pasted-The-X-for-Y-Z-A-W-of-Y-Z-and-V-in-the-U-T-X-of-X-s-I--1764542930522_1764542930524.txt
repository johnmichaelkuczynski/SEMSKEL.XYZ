Before the 1929 N M K, the J's Y I was H G. This F-ed to E's on the D of Y I's that in their C B-ed the 1929 K. The A L-ed to the N M K by T-ing Z Ω, because of which the K F-ed to a Ψ-Φ Θ Π. The Σ Λ-L-ed by Ξ-ing a Ψ1 of Ω1's that, while Ω2-ing the Θ1 to Ω3, Π1-ed Y Π2 on the D of Y Θ2's, F-ing to a 75 Φ1 Φ2 of Φ3 and Φ4. The Ψ2 Ψ3 such Z Φ5 was G-S, which Π3-ed Λ1 Λ2's from Λ3-ing as Λ4 Λ2's, thereby Π1-ing Λ2's from Ω4-ing Λ5 Λ6's to Λ7 their Δ1 Δ2's. Γ-ing in the Ξ1 1980s, these Ω1's Γ1-ed to be Γ2-ed. In 1999, G-S was Γ3-ed; and in 2004, the Γ4's M1 was V-ed. These M's, Γ5-ed with Ψ4 Γ6's of the Ξ2 Γ7, Γ8-ed the Γ9's Ξ3 in Ξ4 after 1929 K. This Ξ5-ed in the 2001 Ξ6 Ξ7 K, which was the Ξ8 of Λ2's Ξ9-ing in what Ξ10-ed Δ3 to be Ξ11 Ξ12's, and Ξ13 in the 2008 Ξ14 K, which was the Ξ8 of Λ2's Ξ9-ing in what Ξ10-ed Δ3 to be Ξ15 Γ4's Ξ16's. In Ξ17 to the 2008 Ξ18, the Σ Ξ19-ed Ξ20-Ξ21, which Ξ22-ed Ψ4 of the Φ5's of G-S. Ξ20-Ξ21 has been Ξ23 at Π1-ing Ψ4 Ξ24's of Ξ25 on the D of Λ2's. That Ξ26-ed, because the Λ8 Ξ27 is Ξ28 so Ξ29, it can Ξ30 the J's Θ1 without Ξ31-ing the Ξ32, this being a Ξ33 that cannot Ξ34 be Ω5-ed Ξ35. Ξ36 II will Ξ37 Y Z in the U T before and during the Q R. Ξ36 III will Ξ37 the Q Ξ38 of V that Ξ39-ed between 1978 and 2004. Ξ36 IV will Ξ37 the Ξ40 of this Ξ38 of V. In Ξ41, it will Ξ37 the 2008 K. Ξ36 IV will also Ξ37 the M's Ξ42-ed by the Σ to Ξ43 the Ξ44 Ξ45-ed by the 2008 and to Π1 Ξ46 such K's. Ξ36 IV will also Ξ37 the Ξ47 and Ξ48 D Ξ49-ed by the Ξ50 A in both the Ξ51 Y I and in Ξ52's to Ω5 it. II. Z-ing Y before and during the Q R
In the Ξ51 Ξ53's, Y was Ξ54 Ξ55 G. There did not Ξ56 Ξ57 Λ2's until 1781. The Ψ2 Ξ58 Ξ59 of Y Z in Ξ51 W was the Ξ60 in 1789 of the Λ2 of the U T (BUS), the J's Ψ2 Ξ61 Λ2. BUS Ξ62-ed Ξ63 the Ξ2 Ξ64's as Ξ65's Ξ61 Λ2, Ξ66 Ξ67-ed as the Ξ50 A: it Ξ68-ed Ξ69 to the Σ (by Ξ70-ing Σ Ξ71's); Ξ68-ed Ξ69 to Ξ72 Λ2's; Ω5-ed Ξ73 between Ξ72 Λ2's and between Λ2's and their Ξ74 Λ5's; and Ξ75-ed, at Ξ76 in Ξ77, as a 'Ξ78 of Ξ79 Ξ80', Ξ81-ing that it would Ξ82 Ξ83's Ξ84-ed by Λ2's under its Ξ85. By Ξ62-ing these Ξ86 Ξ64's, so it was Ξ87-ed, BUS would Ξ88 Ξ89 the J's Θ1 and, in Ξ41, would Ξ90 the Ξ91 and Ξ92 of Y K's. In 1836, BUS's Ξ93 was not Ξ94-ed, because Ψ4 in Ξ95 Ξ96-ed that it had a Ξ97 on the J's Y's. The J would not have Ξ98 Ξ61 Λ2 until 1914. During this Ξ99, the J's Y's were Ξ100-G, to the Ξ101 where Ψ4 Λ2's, Ξ102 on the Ξ103 Ξ104, Ξ84-ed their Δ1 Ξ105. Although the J as a Ξ106 Ξ107-ed during this Φ2, there were Ξ108 Λ8-Ξ109-ed Ξ18's, Ψ4 of them Ξ110-ing Λ2's' having Ξ111 Λ6's to Ξ112 Λ5 Ξ113's. Because of these Ξ18's, the Ξ50 A was Ξ114-ed in 1914, its Ξ115 being to Ξ82 the Ξ116 of Ξ72 Λ2's, Ξ117 Ξ118 Ξ119's, Ξ120 Ξ105, and Ξ121 Ξ69 to the Σ. The A's Ξ95 was Ξ122-ed by the 1863 Ξ123 Λ2 Ξ124 and the 1927 Ξ125 Ξ124, which Ξ126 Π3-ed Λ2's from being Ξ127-ed or Ξ128-ed across Ξ129 Ξ130's. The Ξ123 Λ2 Ξ124 also Ξ131-ed Λ2's to have Ξ132's Ξ133-ing at Ξ76 25% of Λ5-Ξ134's. With the Ξ60 of the A, Ξ132 Ξ135's were Ξ136-ed to 7%-13%. The Ξ137 was that, because the A Ξ138-ed Λ5 Ξ134's, Ξ132 Ξ135's could Ξ139 be Ξ136-ed. The A's Ξ93 was Ξ94-ed Ξ140 Ξ141 to the 1929 K. When the K Ξ142, the A was Ξ143-ed, not Ξ144, as having Ξ145-ed to do its Ξ146 of Ξ89-ing the J's Y I. The K was B-ed by the Ξ147 of a N M Ξ148, Γ5-ed with the Ξ149 that Λ1 Λ2's had Ξ150-ed Λ5-Ξ134's in the N M and had therefore Ξ151-ed those Λ6's, Ξ152-ing their Λ5's with Ξ153 or Ξ154. This Ξ155 was Ξ156-ed by the Ξ149 that in Ψ4 Ξ157's those Λ2's had Ξ158-ed Ξ69 from Γ6 Λ2's to Ξ159 into the M1, with the Ξ8 that the Λ2's' Ξ160's were Ξ161-ed. This F-ed to a Ξ162 Ξ38 of Λ2-Ξ163's, which Ξ164-ed the Θ1. Instead of Ξ165-ing to Ξ166 the Ξ167 of these Ξ163's, the A Ξ168-ed not to Ξ169, its Ξ170 being that these Λ2-Ξ171's, along with the Ξ172 Ξ173-Ξ171's, were the M1 Ξ174-ing a Ξ175 Ξ176. As a Ξ8, the Θ1 Ξ177 Ξ178-ed, F-ing to the Q R. The Σ L-ed by Ξ179-ing to Ω5 Ξ35 the Ξ180 Ξ181's that F-ed to the K. This Ξ182-ed Ξ108 M's, Ξ183 of which are Ξ102 Ξ58. Ψ2, the Σ Ξ114-ed the Ξ50 Ξ134 Ξ184 Ξ185 (FDIC), which Ξ82's that Λ2-Λ5's will not Ξ186 their Λ6's in Ξ157 of Λ2-Ξ187. Ξ188, the Σ Ξ189-ed the Ξ190's and Ξ191 Ξ192, which Ξ131's Ξ193 and Ξ194's Ξ195-ed in the Ξ196 of Ξ190's to Ξ197 with Ξ55 Ξ198. Ξ188, and Ψ2 Ξ199 in this Ξ200, was the Ξ201 of the G-S Ξ124, which Π3-ed Λ1 Λ2's from Ξ202-ing in Λ4 Λ8 Ξ203's, Ξ204-ing Ξ9-ing with Λ5-Ξ134's. G S also Π3-ed Λ2's from Ξ205-ing Ξ206 Ξ194's or from Ξ207-ing Ξ208. These Ξ209 Φ5's were Ξ210-ed Ξ211 that Y Θ2's would be Ξ212 and to Π1 them from Ξ213-ing so Ξ29 and Ξ214-ed that they could Ξ117 M1's. III. V-ing Y (1978-2004)
A Ξ38 of V Γ1-ed in the Ξ215 1970s. In Ξ216 vs. Ψ2 of Ξ217 (1978), the Ξ218 Ξ219 Ξ220-ed that, when Ξ221-ing Ξ118, a Ξ123 Λ2 Ξ222 had to Ξ223 with the Ξ224 Ξ225's of its Ξ226 Ξ129, as Ξ227-ed to its Ξ228 Ξ129. (In Γ6 Ξ229's, if a Λ2 X that is Ξ230-ed in a Ξ129 where the Ξ118 Ξ231 is Ξ232-ed at 30% has a Ξ233 in a Ξ129 where it is Ξ232-ed at 5%, X could Ξ28 Ξ234 30% Ξ118 in that Ξ129.) 
In the 1980s, Ξ108 Ξ124's were Ξ19-ed that V-ed the Ξ226 Ξ121 Ξ235. In 1980, the Ξ236 Θ2's V and Z Ξ117 Ξ124 was Ξ19-ed. This Ξ124 Ξ237-ed Ξ238 Λ2's (Λ2's Ξ239-ing in Ξ226 Ξ121's) to Ξ234 Ξ240 Ξ118 Ξ119's than was Ξ241 Ξ237-ed. And in 1982, the Ξ242-Ξ243. Ξ244 Ξ236 Θ2's Ξ124 was Ξ19-ed. This Ξ124 Ξ237-ed Ξ238 Λ2's to Ξ75 as Λ1 Λ2's and Ξ245 Ξ246. The Ξ201 of these Ξ247 Ξ124's Ξ248 F-ed to a Ξ38 of Ξ238 Λ2 Ξ163's, this being the so-Ξ249-ed 'Ξ250's and Ξ121 Ξ18' of the Ξ215 1980s; but V Ξ251 Ξ252-ed Ξ253. In 1994, Ξ254-Ξ255 Ξ19-ed, Ξ256-ing Ξ257's on Ξ258 Λ8, Ξ259 Ξ260-ing the 1865 Ξ123 Λ2 Ξ124 and the 1927 Ξ125 Ξ124. In 1996, the A Ξ168-ed that, G-S Ξ261, Λ1 Λ2's could in Ξ149 Ξ202 in Λ4 Λ8 Ξ203's, so Ξ262 as such Ξ203's Ξ263-ed no Ξ264 than 5% of their Ξ265 Ξ266. In 1998, Ξ267, a Λ2, Ξ268-ed with Ξ269, and Ξ208 Ξ270. Ξ56 though this Ξ271 Ξ272-ed G-S, it Ξ39-ed with the Ξ273 of the Ξ274's, Ξ275-ing a Ξ276 Ξ277 for Ξ177 such Ξ278's. In 1999, the Ξ279-Ξ280-Ξ281 Ξ124 (Ξ279-Ξ280) was Ξ19-ed. This Ξ124 Ξ282's G S. Ξ283, Λ1 Λ2's were Ξ28 Ξ284 to do Λ4 Λ8. This had Ξ108 S's. Ψ2, Λ1 Λ2's could Ξ150 Λ5 Ξ134's. It also Ξ285-ed that Λ2's could Ξ150 Λ5 Λ6's Ξ286's that are both H Ξ287 and H Ξ47 and therefore Ξ288 Ξ289. Ξ279-Ξ280 was Ξ290 Ξ58, Ξ291-ing to the Ξ292 Ξ293's between Λ1 and Λ4 Λ8. Λ1 Λ2's Ξ294 and Ξ121 Ξ69. Λ4 Λ2's Ξ202 in H Ξ47 Ξ29 Ξ295 Y Ξ296's. For Ξ297, they Ξ88 Ξ194's Ξ268; they Ξ298 Ξ299 for Ξ29 Ξ300 Δ2's; they Ξ301 Ξ302 Ξ303 Ξ304's; they Ξ88 Ξ305 up Ξ306's between the Ξ303 and Ξ307 Ξ308's; and they Ξ309 Ξ190's in Ξ86 Ξ310 M1's. To these Ξ311's, Λ4 Λ2's Ω4 Ξ312 Ξ47 Y Ξ313's, such as Ξ314 Ξ315 Ξ316's, and Ξ317 Ξ56 Ξ318 such Ξ313's. Λ4 Λ8 Ξ203's are Ξ319 to Ξ320, Ξ102 for Ξ321-Λ4 Λ8's, and therefore Ξ319 to Ω5 Ξ259. In 2000, the Ξ322 Ξ323's Ξ324 Ξ124 (CFM) was Ξ19-ed. CFM V-ed the Ξ70-ing and Ξ207-ing of Γ4's, which had Ξ241 been Ξ325 Ξ326-ed by the Ξ322 Ξ323's Ξ327 Ξ192 (CMFT). A Γ4  is a Ξ328 whose Ξ329 is a Ξ330 of the Ξ329 of some Γ6 Ξ331. For an Ξ297, a Ξ332 Ξ323 (a Ξ328 to Ξ159 or Ξ333 Ξ332 at a Ξ334 Ξ323 Ξ335) is a Γ4, since its Ξ329 Ξ336's on the Ξ329 of Ξ332. Ψ2 Γ4's are H Ξ337-ed and H Ξ287, and they Ξ338 to be Ξ288 to Ξ329. Also, there is no Ξ339 to how Ξ47 a Γ4 can be. For Ξ297, Δ4 can Ξ159 an Ξ340 to Ξ159 a Ξ341 of Ξ342's of a Ξ343 Ξ344 Λ4 Ξ345 (REIT) on the Ξ346 that the Ξ342 Ξ329 Ξ347's Ξ348 x but doesn't Ξ349 Ξ348 y on the Ξ346 that it Ξ350's in that Ξ351 for Δ4 Ξ352 Ξ353-ed that the REIT's Ξ354/Ξ355 Ξ356 Ξ357's Ξ358 20:1. Ξ359, in 2004, in SEC Ξ136-ed Ξ132 Ξ135's for Λ2's while Ξ360-ing the Ξ361 of Ξ362 they could Ω4 when Ξ9-ing. This Ξ237-ed Λ2's to Ω4 up to 40x Ξ363 on their Λ4's, Ξ81-ing that they could Ξ364 $40 for every $1 of their Δ1 Ξ69 that they Ξ365 up. IV. S's of V, 2004-P 
Before Ξ37-ing the Ξ40 of V, let us Ξ366 Ξ367. Ξ368-1929, Λ2's could Ξ202 in Λ4 Λ8 Ξ64's, Ξ204-ing Ξ9-ing in the N M, and they could Ω4 Λ5 Λ6's to do so. In the Ξ369 F-ing up to the K, the Ξ51 Ξ303 Ξ150-ed Ξ370 in the N M. Λ2's Ξ371-ed in this, Ξ158-ing from their Λ5's and from Γ6 Λ2's to do so. This Ξ372 Ξ189-ed a Ξ148. This Ξ148 Ξ373, and the Λ2's Ξ151-ed their Ξ69 as Ξ374 as their Λ5's' Ξ69. The A L-ed with Ξ375 Z Ω, which Ξ376-ed the Ξ155, F-ing to the Q R. The Σ L-ed by Ξ377-ing the Y Ξ27. In Ξ41, Θ2's were Π3-ed from Ξ202-ing in both Λ1 and Λ4 Λ8. Ξ264 Ξ378, Y Θ2's were Π3-ed from Ξ379-ing Ξ380's of Ξ381's that Ξ382 Ξ383 Ξ384's of Ξ118. These M's Ξ385-ed Ξ386 Λ2 Λ5's and also Ξ387-ed Y M1's Ξ212. Ξ108 Ξ369's after being Ξ388-ed, these Ξ257's were Ξ389-ed. This Ξ237-ed Λ2's to Ω4 Λ5 Λ6's to Ξ202 in H Ξ47 and Ξ287 Λ4's. Ξ28 Ξ390 from the Ω1's that had Ξ391-ed them during the Ξ241 Ξ108 Ξ369's, Λ2's Γ1-ed Ξ202-ing in Ξ86 M1's. To this Ξ392, they Ξ158-ed Ξ370 from their Δ1 Λ5's and from Γ6 Y Θ2's. Λ2's Ξ150-ed Ξ102 Ξ370 in the Ξ14 M1, which at the Ξ393 was Ξ394-ing Ξ395. (This was Ξ396-ed by the Ξ241 Ξ397-ed V of the Ξ226 Ξ121 Ξ235.) This F-ed to a Ξ162 Ξ38 of Λ2-Ξ271's and Λ2-Ξ398's. Λ2's having Ξ399 Ξ400's Ξ268-ed, so as to Ξ401 their Ξ402 to Ξ403 on the Ξ14 M1.


(In particular, X banks Y-ing in Z A B-s C-ed with banks Y-ing in D E-s.) And F banks, some of them G-ing from such C-s, simply H-ed out I-er banks. (In particular, F X banks J-ed I-er banks that K-ed in D E-s.) During the 1980s and 1990s, there were approximately 7,300 such C-s and L-s. The banks that M-ed N-ed an O-ly P Q of R-s to O-ly F S-T-s. These now U-V X banks W-ed Z A X-s to Y from the D Z-Ω, the most Γ of these being Δ-ed Θ Λ-s (CDO). A CDO is a Ξ (Π-Σ A Ψ) Ω-ing of a Φ of Θ-Χ-s, such as D E-s and Ѡ Ϟ-s. The Ͱ of a CDO ͱ-s Ͳ ͳ-s, much as a Ϟ-Ͱ ͱ-s Ͳ ʹ ͳ-s. A ͵-Ͷ-ed ͷ (MBS) is a CDO that ͸-s ͻ of ͼ-ͽ E-s, e.g., D E-s and ;-Ϳ ΀-s. Like most X-s, CDO's, including MBS's, are ΁-ly ΂-ly Ã-ed, ΂-ly Ä-Å, and Æ to Ç. È to the É in 2000 of the Ê Ë Ì Act, banks could now Í-ly Î, Ï, and Ð CDO's. A CDO's Ñ Ò-s on the Ñ of the Ó E-s and therefore Ô-s to Õ if those E-s are Ö-ed on, and MBS's × all their Ñ if the Ó ͵-s are Ö-ed on. Ø-Ù, CDO's are a Ú Û of Ü so long as the Ó E-s Ý-ed to be Þ-ed. CDO's, and MBS's in particular, are ß because they à-ed it á to â the ͼ ͽ Z-Ω. There is no ã to ä the å of æ without ç-ing this è, and a é ê in ë is therefore in ì. The í of a D î-s to ï ð to its Ñ; the í will not ñ unless the ò Ñ ó-s, and the í therefore î-s to ï ô-ly õ in the ö ÷. With Ξ-s, such as ø-s, the ù is very ú. In the ö-÷, there is very û ü between the í of a ø and the Ñ of the Ó ý; the two can þ without ÿ, and such Ā-s can ā rapidly. If a F Ă of ă-s of a ý are Ą-ed in a ö ą of Ć, the í is ć to Ĉ, even though the Ñ of the ý hasn't ĉ-ed; and if a F Ă of ă-s are Ċ-ed in a ö ą of Ć, the í is ć to ċ, even though the Ñ of the ý hasn't Č-ed. A č is that a Ď or ď with Đ đ can Ē a ø be ē by Ą-ing it up and can also Ĕ its Ñ by Ċ-ing F ĕ-s of it. Ė-ly, when ͼ-ͽ Θ-s were ė-ed into A Ξ-s, such as MBS's, the Z-Ω could Ē them far more ē than the Ó Ψ-s, and could do so in a Ę of ę-s, and the Z-Ω could Ě-ly ě-ly and Ĝ their Ñ ĝ that of the Ó Ψ-s. In a Ğ, the í and the Ñ of a Ξ can þ without ÿ and can do so more or less rapidly; and this Ğ-s no less of MBS's than it does of ğ ø-s. Ġ-ly, ġ-s can Ē đ from ĉ-s and Č-s in a Ξ's í; they Ē đ from ĉ-s by by Ą-ing it Ģ-ly or Ą-ing X-s, such as ģ Ĥ-s, that ĉ with í-ĉ-s in the Ó); and they Ē đ from Č-s by ĥ-Ċ-ing it or Ħ Ą-ing X-s, such as ħ-Ĥ-s, that ĉ in Ñ with í-Č-s in the Ó. Ĩ ġ-s are ć to have ĩ-s Ω-ing of Ī and ĥ ĩ-s, so as to Y from ö-÷ í-ñ-s. Let us now Ĭ the ĭ of these è-s to the å of æ. Once ͵-s and other ͼ-ͽ Θ-s were Į-ed, Ͱ-s of these Ξ-s (į-ly F X banks) had İ ı-s to Ĝ up the Ă of D E ĩ-s, IJ of the ij of those E-s. This is because, as just Ĵ-ed, the Ñ of MBS's can þ without ÿ from the Ñ of the Ó Ψ-s, and ĵ-s are Ķ to ķ Ñ to ĸ-ly Ĺ Ξ-s, at least in the ö and ĺ ÷-s, simply by Ļ-ing them up. Because X banks now themselves ļ-ed many of the banks that Ľ-ed such E-s, they Ľ-ed them ľ-ly, IJ of the Ŀ (or ŀ thereof) of the E Ł-s. As for ͵-Ľ-ing banks that were not ļ-ed by F X banks, they too had strong ı-s to Ľ such E-s, given that X banks were ł to Ħ them from them. A Ń is that ń Ņ-s were Ľ-ed at O Ň-s. A ń Ņ is a ň-Ń Ņ Ľ-ed to someone who is not Ŀ, the ň Ń Ŋ Ŋ-ing to ŋ against ň Ō of ō. The Ń Ŋ-s on ń Ņ-s Ŏ out ŏ-ly Ő, so as to ő Œ œ-s, and then Ŕ up after a few ŕ-s, so as to Ŗ Y-s for the Ņ-Ľ-er. For many ŗ-s, one of them being that Ņ-s were indeed Ľ-ed so Í-ly, D í-s Ř-ly ĉ-ed during the Ś 2000s. D í-s soon Ť-ed D-Ñ-s and for a ť Ý-ed to do by an Ŧ-ŧ-ing Ũ, ũ-ing that the D Z-Ω had Ū-ed ū-Ŭ. But while they ŭ, ū-s are not Ů-ed for what they are, and this was no ů. Ė-ly, the Ű in D-í-s was Ů-ed as ű that D-s were an Ř-ly Ų ų. Ė-ly, more and more Ď---and therefore more and more Ď who were Ŵ and ŵ--Ą-ed into the D Z-Ω; and Ř-ly Ŷ ń Ņ-s were Ľ-ed to Ď who were Ř-ly ŷ to be Ķ to Ÿ them. Meanwhile, the F X banks Ą-ing and Ξ-s these Ř-ly Ź Ņ-s. Since such ų-s were so ź, they were often ΂-ly Ã-ed. Ė-ly, the ë-s of these X banks, as well as of the banks they Ż-ed from, ż-ed on the Ñ of these Ξ-s. D í-s Ž-ed in 2006 and then ž-ed to ſ. There were ƀ-ly two ŗ-s for this. First, ū-s can only ŭ so long; Ɓ-ly, í-s and Ñ-s ƃ. When í-s are Ƅ-ed, ƅ Ɓ-ly Ɔ-s to Ƈ ƈ with Ɖ. At this è, Ͱ-s of the Ƅ-ed Ψ-s ƊƋ to ƌ Y-s by Ċ-ing them; this Ɗ-s a ƍ ƎƏ, which ΁-ly doesn't until the Ψ has Ċ-ed ƐƑ to or ĝ its ò Ñ. ƒ, many D-Ͱ-s simply Ɠ-ed ũ-ing their Ņ ͳ-s. A Ɣ Ă of Œ D-Ͱ-s had Ņ-s that Ɠ-ly Ť-ed what they could ƕ and were in many Ɩ-s simply Ŵ; and the Ń Ŋ-s on those Ņ-s were often Ɨ-ly ň, ũ-ing it Ƙ-ly Æ for them to Ē their ͳ-s. Also, Ņ ͳ-s were ƙ-ed to Ƅ-ed D-í-s; and now that D í-s were Ƃ-ing to their Ƨ Ň-s, it Ř-ly Ƨ-ed to Ē A Ơ for D-Ͱ-s to Ý to Ē their Ņ ͳ-s, since doing so was ơ to Ƣ-ing Ƣ-s Ƥ í-s for a Ƥ. This ƥ-ed the Ʀ of Ď who simply Ƨ-ed to Ē their Ņ ͳ-s. As more and more Ď Ö-ed on their Ņ ͳ-s, the MBS's Ω-ing of these Θ-Λ-s ž-ed to × Ñ. Indeed, because these MBS's were Ã-ed, often as much as 40x, their Ñ was Ƨ-Ƨ-ly Ƅ-ed ô to already Ƅ-ed D í-s: the MBS Z-Ω was a ū on Ƨ of the D Z-Ω ū. Ė-ly, when MBS's ž-ed to × Ñ, they did so  at an Ƨ Ŋ ô to the × of Ñ of the Ó Θ-Λ-s. Ė-ly, the Ñ of MBS's Ư-ed Õ well Ư that of the Ó Θ-Λ-s. This is Ʊ of X-s Ʋ-ly, ƻ-ly ΂-ly Ã-ed one: Ƴ Ƴ-s in the Ó Ƴ Ƴ Ƴ-s in the X. And this is what Ʒ here: D í-s Č-ed by 10-20%, Ƴ-ing MBS's to ċ in Ñ, often to Õ. Also, if an ų is ΂-ly Ã-ed, even a ƺ ſ is Đ to Ƽ the ġ. This is too is what Ʒ here: F banks ų-ed so much in MBS's and W-ed so much Ã in those ų-s that they simply weren't in a ĩ to Ƣ their ƽ-s when those ų-s Ƅ-ed. The so-Ǝ-ed 2008 Ǝ did not ƊƋ when D í-s ž-ed to Ô. It ž-ed when the banks Ǝ for the D ū ž-ed to Ô. This ž-ed in Ś 2007. Đ Ď had Ö-ed on their Ņ-s, Ƴ-ing a Ǝ of bank Ǝ-s. This Ǝ ž-ed with ǝ, Ǝ banks and Ǝ-ed its Ǝ up to Ǝ banks. In Ǝ 2007, Ǝ Ǝ A, a F-Ǝ ń Ǝ, Ǝ-ed for Ǝ, this being the first Ǝ of Ǝ. But the Ǝ ž-ed in Ǝ with the Ô of Ǝ Ǝ in Ǝ 2007. A Ǝ-Ǝ X bank, Ǝ Ǝ was Ǝ-ly ų-ed in MBS's and in other D-Ǝ-ed CDO's. When D-Ͱ-s Ö-ed on their Ņ-s, Ǝ Ǝ's Ǝ ċ-ed in Ñ. Because its Ψ-s were ΂-ly Ã-ed, this Ǝ-ed to Ǝ Ǝ-s; and because these Ǝ Ǝ-s were so F, Ǝ Ǝ Ǝ-ed itself in the Ǝ of Ƣ-ing them. Meanwhile, its ġ-s Ǝ-ed to Ǝ their đ, but Ǝ Ǝ no longer had their đ. At this è, Ǝ Ǝ was Ǝ-ly Ŵ. In Ǝ 2008, J.P. Ǝ Ą-ed up what was left of Ǝ Ǝ. The Ǝ Ǝ Ǝ-ed the Ǝ, by Ǝ-ing up to $30 Ǝ Ǝ-s' Ǝ of the Ψ-s J.P. Ǝ was Ǝ-ing. (In other Ğ-s, if the Ψ-s being Ǝ-ed Ǝ-ed out to be Ǝ less than the Ǝ í, the Ǝ would ķ J.P. Ǝ the Ǝ in its Ǝ if it was less than $30 Ǝ or it would ķ J.P. Ǝ $30 Ǝ if the Ǝ Ť-ed $30 Ǝ.) When J.P. Ǝ Ǝ-ed to Ħ out what was left of Ǝ Ǝ, it Ǝ-ed that its Ǝ Ψ-s were ē Đ to Ǝ the đ and Ǝ Ǝ-ed, ƻ-ly given the Ǝ's $30 Ǝ Ǝ of Ǝ. This Ǝ-ed to a Ǝ. The Ǝ í Ť-ed the Ǝ Ñ of Ǝ Ǝ's Ψ-s by more than $30 Ǝ. As Ǝ-ed, the Ǝ Ǝ J.P. Ǝ $30 Ǝ. But the Ǝ was still a Ǝ for J.P. Ǝ, given how Ĺ its Ǝ-ing Ψ-s Ǝ-ed to be and how İ its Ǝ-s Ǝ-ed out to be. Ǝ Ǝ-s, another Ǝ X bank, Ô-ed in Ǝ 2008. It did so for the same ŗ-s as Ǝ Ǝ: it was Ǝ-ų-ed in CDO's that Ǝ Ĺ when D-Ͱ-s Ö-ed on their Ņ-s. The Ǝ of Ǝ Ǝ-s was even more Ǝ than that of Ǝ Ǝ. First of all, Ǝ Ǝ-s was much F-er than Ǝ Ǝ. Before the Ǝ of the D Z-Ω, Ǝ Ǝ-s was Ǝ approximately Ǝ Ć-s as much as Ǝ Ǝ; and after the Ǝ, it Ǝ-ed Ǝ Ć-s as much. Therefore, in the Ɩ of Ǝ Ǝ-s, Ǝ Ć-s as much Θ was left Ǝ-Þ-ed. As with Ǝ Ǝ, Ǝ Ǝ-s had ų-ed on Ǝ, Ż-ing up to $40 for every $1 one of its own that it W-ed. When CDO's ċ-ed in Ñ, Ǝ Ǝ-ed many Ć-s more đ than it had, and it therefore couldn't Ƣ its Θ-s. Much of this Θ was to ƽ banks, and these were therefore Ƽ-ed when Ǝ Ǝ-s Ö-ed. The Ǝ Ǝ-ed to Ǝ out Ǝ, F-ly because its Θ-s were too F; and it Ǝ-ed to Ǝ any Ǝ or Ǝ-s to any ď Ǝ to Ħ up what was left of Ǝ. Ė-ly, Ǝ's Ǝ of Ǝ simply Ǝ-ed, and its ƽ-s were Þ-ed Ǝ. The so-Ǝ-ed Ǝ of 2008 was really two Ǝ Ǝ-s: a D Ǝ and a Ǝ Ǝ.


A-ing B's were C-ed, and these C-ed B's eventually began to D to their E F's, which G-ly H-ed the I's of J who had K-ed L's at C-ed B's: this was the A-ing M. It also N-ed the many O's that had P-ed the A-ing Q, which greatly R-ed S to T: this was the O-ing M. The first M U-ed the V of W, which X-ed Y of Z. The second M X-ed the V of AA, which AB-ed the AC's AD to AE that AF-ed W. AC's AG on AA as much as they do on W; when AH's cannot AI, they AJ and the AC therefore AJ's. The O-ing M AK-ed the O's that had AL-ed in the A-ing AM, and it AK-ed the O's that had AN those O's the AO to AL in the A-ing AM. The AP was a O-ing AQ that was increasingly AR to AS AA to AH's and J who AT-ed it. AU-AV and Other AW-2008 AX AY
While this AZ of O BA's was BB-ing, there were two BC's of BD concerning it. One the one, for the BE's just BF, some BG that the BH should BI the BJ's by BK-ing out the O's. On the other BL, some BG that the O's were BA-ing because they were BA-ing the AC and that they should therefore be BM-ed to AJ. The BH BN the BO that the O's should be BK-ed out. If the O-ing AQ were BM-ed to BP, so the BQ BR went, the AC would BT to a BU; and the O's must therefore be BK-ed out, however BV their BW BX had been. So, in 2008, the BH BY-ed the BZ CA CB (CD). The most CE CF of this CG was to CH $700 CI CJ-ing CK's from the O's that CL-ed them. Since these CK's were now CM, this CN-ed to simply CO-ing BA-ing O's $700 CI. As this AO was being CP-ed, I's of CQ's CR-ed to CS their L's; the CT CU of L's AF-ed was 3.8 CV. CD CW with CX CY from two CZ's. On the one BL, many were DA-ed at the DB that O's were DC being DD-ed for nearly DE-ing the AC through DF and DG, especially when DH was being DI to DJ the I's who had AF-ed their L's or the I's who had AF-ed their DK's because of the DL DM. On the other BL, many BG that the BH DN was DO-ing the AC from DP-ing itself of these DP DQ-ed O's and either DR-ing them with DS and DT O's and DU DV-ing a DS and DT DW of O-ing. The M DX-ed the DY DZ to EA: it was the EB DY DZ EC since 1929, ED-ing even the 2000 EE EF EC. CD EG-ed the DY DZ from EH-ing even EI, and this would certainly EJ to be CD's EK. But even this is EL. The EM the DN EN-ed the DY DZ is that the O's that were being EO-ed EP a EQ ER of the ES's in the DZ. Therefore, so it could be ET, the DN simply EU-ed these O's to EV EW over the DZ. On the other BL, so it could be ET, O EX in the DZ EY's EZ the FA's whose ES is being FB-ed. FC how this FD is to be FE-ed is not FF; the FG DB is that CD, though FH FI FJ for the AC, was not FK so. In 2008, the BH BY-ed and FL-ed the FM FN FO (FP) which FQ-ed FR FS FT's to FU's and AH's. This greatly FV-ed the V of AO that J and AH's had at their FW to CH and AL with. At the FX FY, the FZ GA GB-ed GC GD's from 4.25% to GE GF—the GH in the GI of the GA. Both GJ's were GK-ed to GL the V of GM in the AC. This GB-ed the GN of AI-ing AO, GO-ing the AD of J and AH's to CH and AL. As GP-ed, both GJ's FV-ed GQ-ing and GR. This GS-ed the AC to GT. It also GU to a DY DZ GV. (This GV GW-ed into a Q, which GX in GY 2022, GZ-ing in HA DY DZ EC. The HB of this is HC-ed HD.)
There are two BC's of BD concerning these two GJ's. On the one BL, some HE they were HF to EG the M from HG to a HH. On the other BL, some HE that, although they FQ-ed HI HJ HK HL, they FI HM-ed the AC by HN-ing the HO and GO-ing HP, on the HQ of both AH's and FU's, on BH HR's. Either HS, they HT HU the AC a much-HV-ed HI-HJ HW. At the FX FY, they did HX to HY the AX HZ that had EU-ed the M to IA in the first IB. IC, the BH did ID to IE the IF AX IG's, the most CE such ID being the IH-IJ IK of 2010. IH-IJ had IL IF's. First, it IM-ed the DL IN IO IP (IQ) and the IR IS IT (IU). The IV's IW DL IX's; and when it IY's them to be in IZ JA of BA-ing, it JB's with them to JC how to JD the JE. When a DL IX is JF the JG of no JH, the IQ JI's how to JJ it JK and JL it in a JM JN JO, and the IU JP's the JQ JR to do this. JS, IH-IJ IM-ed the FZ JT JU (JV), which IV-ed JW JX JY's and JZ-ed to KA those on the KB of KC to be JL-ed in a JM JN JO. KD, IH-IJ KE-ed the KF DL KG KH (KI). The KI is KJ-ed with DO-ing O's from KK-ing in KL KM-ing. To this KN, KI KO's O's to KP with IL KQ's when KR-ing KS's. First, O's are KO-ed to be KT KU with KV's about the KW's of the KS's it is KX-ing them. KY, it KZ's O's from LA-ing KV's towards KS's with LB KW's when there are LC KS's with LD KW's, and it therefore LE's O's from LF-ing KS's that LG the O as LH to the KV. The KI also LI's AA and LJ LK's, LK-ing LK LL's to LM LK-LN LO in as KU a LP as LQ. LR, the KI LS's and LT's KV LU's concerning O's and AA LK's. More LV, IH-IJ LW's KL LX in LY with AA LK's. LZ IH-IJ, O's MA-ed a MB MC of MD-GC ME MF AA LK's. This MG MH-ed with MI AA who either had no MJ's or didn't MK what they were ML themselves into. Either HS, this MG was KL, and IH-IJ MN-ed it. Also, LZ IH IJ, O's MO-ly MP-ed MD-GC LJ and AA LK's to MQ MR's, MS-ing up MT's on MQ MU's to this KN. This MG MH-ed J who were DL MV and MW to MK what they were ML into. IH IJ MN-ed this MG. IH IJ also KO-ed AA LK's to IE the KW's and MY's of the LK's they MA-ed as FF as LQ: it was no MZ an NA for them to NB NC ND NE. The NF NG is HA CE CF of IH-IJ. The NF NG LW's the NH to which O's may KK in NI NJ-ing. NI NJ-ing is when a O NK's KV NL's with the NM of NN-ing NO's for itself. NI NJ-ing is to be NP-ed from NQ-ing as a NR NS that NT's NU's for a NV and NW's AO from NX's rather than from the NY itself. NS's IE AO only from NZ OA's; when they OB a OC NY on a NV's OD, they do not OE in the NO's, and they don't OE in the OF's when they OB an OG NY on a NV's OD. OH, the V of AO to be OI from OJ-ing is KT OK. By OL, there is no OM to how much one IE from NI NJ-ing, since there is no OM to how much an GR can ON in OO; but one can also CS OP, since GR's can OQ to GF. OR, the NF NG does not OS OT O's from KK-ing in NI NJ-ing. It OU OV's O's to KK in NI NJ-ing OW that they OX KV NL's with their own NL's when OY so. In other OZ's, PA a O KK's in a NI GR, it must IE the FX GR, in the FX ER, PB its own AO. PC PD, O's are not EU-ed to IE NY's with KV NL's that they are not also PE-ing PB their own NL's. The NF NG does not OT O's from KK-ing on their own OD. It only OT's them from OY so with KV PF's. JW O's KA FR NJ-ing PG's. These NJ-ing PG's KA the AD to NT I's of NY's in a PH of a PI. They also KA PJ PK PL to both T and LO. OH, while the NF NG may EG O's from PM-ing KV NL's on MI NY's, it does HX to EG them PN-ing DZ's in other PO's—a DB whose PL we will PP JC. While not OT-ing O's from FB-ing on their own OD or even PR from OY so with KV NL's, the NF NG does KO that that PS and GR PT's of O's be PU PV-ed. The two must be PV-ed by a so-PW-ed "PX", PY that they cannot PZ directly with each other, even though they are CL-ed and QA-ed by the FX QB's. The QC of such a PX IE's it QD to QE KV NL's in NI NY's. OY so KO's the QF of a QG of QH QI O QJ's, each KJ-ed with QK-ing QL with all FG QM's. In QN, the NF NG KO's each O to KA a AX QO within itself which QP-ed the QQ NL's QR the PS and GR QS's of the O on the FG QM's. The NF NG also OT's O's from QT-ing with QU NL's and QV QW QX's. A QU NL is a PJ QY-ed IX that KK's in MD-QZ NY's on OD of RA RB's. A QV QW IX is a IX that AL's in RC-up's, which is RD RE. By OT-ing such RF's, the NF NG LW's the NH to which JW O's can RG themselves and, by RH, the DZ as a RI. The NF NG IV's and LI's O's' QE of MD-QZ RJ's, such as CK's, RK-ing in when it IY's that a O is RL-ing them and RM RN-ing both itself and its RO's. KY, the NF NG IM-ed RP RJ RQ's. RR to the 2008 M, RJ's were FB-ed RS, as LH to through an RQ. This had IL RT's. First, there was PK RU QZ, PY that one of the QB's to a NZ might simply not RV. Also, there was HX to EG RW's who could not DU KA RX RY on OF's from RZ-ing into RJ NZ's. LR, in the SA of such RQ's, there was no HS for SB's to IV RJ SC's or therefore to SD SE of RJ-LN SF's. RR to the 2008 EC, AA SG SH's had SI SJ SK's to O's that did not SL them. There was no SM HS of SG-ing AA SH's themselves, and such SH's were therefore RD SN. To SO this SP, IH-IJ IM-ed the JU of AA SQ's (SR). A SS of the ST SU and RQ SV (SW), the SR SX's AA SG SH's and SY's that their SK's are SZ. LR, IH-IJ TA-ed on TB TC TD TE's. TF IH-IJ, the DL TG's for TD-ing were FV-ed. Also, the TH of J who could be TD's was TA-ed.


Previously, one could X the Y on a given Z only if one W-ed directly for that Z. Under A-B, C's of Z's D-ed with a given Z could X the Y on it, provided that they did indeed have E F. Also, A-B G-ed H's to I forward up to 180 J's after the K's had L-ed a M on the N of the Z in O. The P Q of A-B: In 2018,the R S, T U and V W X (Y) was Z-ed. Y P-ly Q-ed some Ω's of A-B. Under Y, the Δ Φ no longer Ψ's to Λ's with less than $10 Θ. Also, under Y, Λ's must be Ξ at least $250 Θ to be Π-ed "too Σ to Ω1." Under A-B, in its Ω2 Ω3, Λ's only had to be Ξ $50 Θ to Ω4 into this Ω5. Many of the Ω6's of A-B only Ω7 with Ω8 to Λ's that are Π-ed too Σ to Ω1, and Y therefore Ω9's the Ω10 of A-B. That Ω11-ed, Y Ω12-ed the Ω13 Ω14 of A-B Ω15, Ω16-ing that it did Ω17 a non-Ω18 Ω19 on A-B. According to its Ω20's, Y would Ω21 Σ Λ's Ω22 Ω23 and will likely Ω24 to another R Ω25. According to its Ω26's, Y would Ω27 Ω28 R S by Ω29-ing A B, which, so they Ω30, Ω31-ed the R Ω32 and the Ω33 as a Ω34. More Ω35-ly, Ω36's of A-B have the following Ω20's of it:
Ω20 #1: A-B Ω37's the Ω38 of Ω39 (Ω40) in the Ω33. This Ω41's Ω41's that Ω42's and Ω43's have less Ω44 to Ω45 for Ω46 and Ω47 Ω48's. A B Ω49's Ω50 Ω51's for Λ's. This Ω9's how much Ω40 they can Ω52 out, and it also Ω9's how much they can Ω53. Ω20 #2: By Ω9-ing what Ω53 Λ's can do in the Ω54 of Ω55-ing Ω56's, A-B Ω9's how much R Z's can Ω57 and therefore Ω9's how much R's can Ω57. Ω20 #3: A-B is Ω58. A-B Ω59-ed a Ω60 T Ω61 that is Ω58 to Ω62 and Ω63. This Ω40 Ω64's out of the Ω33 and therefore Ω65's it. Ω20 #4: A-B Ω49's Ω66's for Λ's, and Λ's Ω67 these Ω66's onto to the Ω68 in the Ω3 of Ω69 Ω70's and Ω37-ed Ω71 to Ω72 Ω68 Ω73's (e.g. Ω37-ed Ω71 to Ω21 out Ω74 Ω75's). Ω20 #5: A-B Ω21's Ω76 Ω77's Ω22 Ω78 over the R Ω79. A-B Ω21's the Ω76 the Ω23 to Ω80 when a Λ or Ω81 Z is on the Ω82 of Ω83, and Ω21's it the Ω23 to Ω84 it. This could Ω85 the R Ω79, since Ω76 Ω77's do not Ω86 Ω87 than R Ω88's how to Ω89 the Ω90 of a Z. Also, it Ω17's an Ω19 on the Ω91 Ω92 and therefore on Ω93 in Ω94. Ω20 #6: A-B Ω85's Ω95 Λ's, since they can't Ω96 the Ω97 T Ω66's, but it doesn't Ω85 Ω98 Λ's, since they can Ω96 them. Consequently, A-B has Ω24-ed to a Ω99 in which a few Ω100-Λ's Ω101 the R Ω79. Later we will Ω89 these Ω20's. By Ω54 of Ω102, each is either Ω103 or is Ω104-ed by a Ω105-ing Ω106-Ω20. The Ω107 Ω108 with A-B, we will Ω109, is that it doesn't Ω110 Ω111 Ω112. A-B Ω113's Ω114 Ω3's of Ω115 or otherwise Ω116 Ω117 on the N of Λ's. But it does Ω118 to Ω9 the Ω119 of Λ's, and it therefore does Ω118 to Ω113 the Ω120 they can do by Ω121 of being so Ω98. The Ω122 of Ω123 Ω124's: Ω123 Ω124's have an Ω125 Ω126 on the R Ω79 and the Ω33 as a Ω34, and the just-Ω127-ed Ω128's are to some Ω129 to be Ω130-ed in Ω131's of the Ω123-Ω124 Ω132's that have Ω133-ed over the last several Ω134's. Let us Ω135 with some Ω94 Ω136's. Ω137's to Ω138 are Ω137's to Ω138-Ω124's, viz. Ω124's at which the Ω139 is Ω140-ing Ξ. "Ω138 is at 13%" Ω41's that, at the Ω141 Ω124, the Ω139 is Ω140-ing 13% of its Ξ per Ω142. Ω138 Ω124's Ω143 Ω144-ly on Ω123 Ω124's. Ω123 Ω124's are Ω145 by the Ω146 Ω147. When Ω123 Ω124's are Ω148, Ω40 is Ω149; Ω42's Ω150 Ω151-ly; this Ω152's up Ω66's, Ω41-ing that there is Ω138. When Ω124's are Ω153, Ω40 is Ω58; Ω42's don't Ω150 Ω151-ly; Ω66's Ω154, Ω41-ing that there is Ω155. Ω138 is more of a Ω156 than a Ω157, since the Ω33 Ω143's on the Ω158 Ω23 of the Ω139. But there is a Ω157 Ω159 to Ω138; when Ω42's Ω150 Ω151-ly, this being the Ω160 of Ω138, Ω43's do Ω161, Ω24-ing to Ω148 Ω162's and Ω148 Ω163. Similarly, there is a Ω156 Ω159 to Ω155: when Ω42's don't Ω150 Ω151-ly, this being the Ω160 of Ω155, Ω43's do not do Ω161, Ω24-ing to Ω162 Ω164's and Ω165's. The Ω166 Ω167 is one in which Ω138 Ω168's Ω169-ly (at, for Ω170, an Ω171 Ω124 of 2%). When the Ω33 is Ω172-ing, the Ω146 Ω173's to Ω174 Ω123 Ω124's, which Ω175's the Ω33 but Ω24's to Ω138. When Ω138 is too Ω148, the Ω146 Ω176's Ω124's, which Ω177's Ω138 but Ω178's down the Ω33. When the Ω146 Ω176's Ω124's, that Ω41's that the Ω76 has to Ω179 Ω148 Ω123 Ω124 on its Ω180. This Ω9's how much the Ω146 can Ω176 Ω124's. If the Ω76's Ω180 is too Ω98, then too much of an Ω123 Ω124 Ω181 would Ω182 the Ω76 R-ly. Thus, when Ω76 Ω180 is Ω148, as it is now, there is only so much that the Ω146 can Ω176 Ω123 Ω124's without Ω59-ing a Ω99 Ω183 than the Ω138 that those Ω181's are Ω184 to Ω185. In 1980, Ω138 was at 14%. (In other Ω186's, the Ω139 was Ω140-ing Ξ at a Ω124 of 14%/Ω142. In Ω94, Ω137's to Ω138 are Ω137's to Ω138-Ω124's, viz. Ω124's at which the Ω139 is Ω140-ing Ξ.) Then Ω146 Ω187 Ω188 Ω189 Ω190-ed with this Ω108 by Ω176-ing Ω123 Ω124's from approximately 5% to 20%. This Ω191-ed the Ω108; within two Ω142's, Ω138 Ω192-ed to under 5%. During this Ω193, it should be Ω194-ed out, the Ω76 had Ω195-ly Ω196 Ω180: its Ω180 to Ω197 (Ω198 Ω199 Ω200) Ω201 was 31.80%, whereas the Ω76's Ω141 Ω180 to Ω197 Ω201 is 130%. In 1980, it was therefore Ω202 to Ω176 Ω123 Ω124's without R-ly Ω203-ing the Ω76, whereas that it much less of a Ω204 now. During the 1980s, Ω123 Ω124's Ω169-ly Ω205-ed Ω206-ward, while still Ω207-ing Ω148; but in the 1990s, Ω123 Ω124's Ω208-ed to under 10%. In the Ω209 2000s, in the Ω210 Ω211 of the Ω212 Ω213 Ω214, Ω123 Ω124's were further Ω215-ed, Ω216-ing to 5%. Ω153 Ω123 Ω124's Ω217-ed the Ω218 R Ω219's that Ω24-ed to the 2008 Ω220. Because Ω40 was so Ω149, Λ's Ω221-ed Ω222-ly and were Ω223 to Ω224 on Ω148-Ω225 Ω226's, such as Ω227's. The Ω228 on the N of the Ω146/Ω76 to the 2008 was to Ω174 Ω123 Ω124's still further; in Ω229, they were Ω174-ed to near Ω230---the Ω153-est Ω124's in R Ω231. The Ω232 of this was to Ω233 Ω40 into the Ω33, so as to Ω234 its Ω235. This Ω236 W-ed: the Ω33 Ω210-ly Ω237-ed to Ω235, and the Ω238 Ω92, which Ω208-ed in 2008, soon Ω239-ed new Ω148's. Some Ω240 that Ω174-ing Ω123 Ω124's was a strictly Ω241 Ω131 Ω242 and Ω65-ed the Ω243's of the Ω33; others Ω244 that it Ω27-ed the Ω33 in both the Ω241 and Ω245 Ω131's. The first Ω246 is probably Ω247 to the Ω248. In 2022, Ω138 Ω239-ed 14%. (Some Ω240 that the Ω249 Ω138 Ω124 was much Ω69.) This was a Ω250 of thirty Ω142's of Ω153 Ω123 Ω124's and Ω251 Ω252 Ω253. The Ω146 Ω228-ed by Ω176-ing Ω123 Ω124's 500%. The Ω232 of this was to Ω177 Ω138 by Ω178-ing down the Ω33. It Ω254's to have W-ed. The Ω33 Ω178-ed down Ω255-ly, Ω24-ing to Ω256's of Ω257 Ω258's and Ω256's of Ω179 Ω164's; and the Ω238 Ω92 Ω259-ed—the fourth Ω98-est Ω260 in Ω261 Ω231 in Ω131's of Ω262 and the Ω183-est in Ω131's of Ω263 Ξ. As a Ω264, Ω138 has Ω237-ed to Ω265, albeit rather Ω266-ly. But because the Ω76's Ω180 to Ω197 Ω201 is so Ω148 (140%), Ω148 Ω123 Ω124's Ω267 it Ω268-ly Ω58 for the Ω76 to Ω72 its Ω180; and if they aren't Ω174-ed, the Ω76 would likely have to Ω269 on its Ω180, which would be a Ω270, since it would Ω271 all Ω272 in the Ω139. But if Ω123 Ω124's are Ω174-ed, Ω138 will once again Ω273 to Ω274 Ω275's. In any Ω276, during the Ω153 Ω123 Ω124 Ω193 from 1990 to 2022, the Ω226's under Ω277 by Ω53 Λ's and Ω278 Ω279's Ω280 Ω281-ly. As a Ω264, Ω98 Ω53 Λ's Ω282-ed Ω95 R Ω283's, Ω284-ing in the Ω99 we have today, where a few Ω100Λ's have Ω285's of Ω286's of Ω139's' Ξ of Ω226's under Ω277 and where, more Ω94-ly, the R Ω287 is a Ω288-ly Ω98 N of the Ω33. A few Ω289's will Ω267 it Ω290 how Ω291 our Ω141 Ω99 is. The Ω261's Ω292 Ω293 Ω294 is approximately $120 Ω286. Its Ω295 Ω226's are approximately $270 Ω286, and its Ω295 Ω296's are approximately $150 Ω286.) Approximately one third of the Ω261's Ω294 is Ω297-ed, or simply Ω298-ed, by a few Ω283's. Ω299 has $10 Ω286 under Ω277; Ω300, $8 Ω286; Ω301, Ω302, and Ω303 Ω304, $4 Ω286 each; Ω305 Ω306, Ω307. Ω308, Ω309, and Ω310 Ω311, $3 Ω286 each; Ω312 Ω313, Ω314 Ω315, and Ω316, $2 Ω286. Each; and Ω317 Ω318, Ω319, Ω320 of R, and Ω321, $1.5 Ω286 each. In other Ω186's, the top 11 Ω283's Ω267 $46 Ω286 Ω139's, in a Ω322 whose Ω292 Ξ is $125 Ω286. These Ω100Λ's have Ω282-ed many Ω323 Λ's or have Ω324 them out of Ω43. At the same Ω325, these Ω100Λ's have Ω195-ly Ω196 Ω326 in Ω72-ing the Ω327's whose Λ's they Ω328-ed. It is more Ω329 for a Ω100Λ to Ω330 on a few Ω291-ly Ω98 Ω331's than it is to Ω332 its Ω40 and Ω333's on Ω334's of Ω335-ed Ω327's. Consequently, the Ω43 Ω73's of those Ω327's are not as Ω161 Ω72-ed as they were when they still had their own Ω336 Λ's. Ω337 and Ω338 Ω339 Ω87 and Ω149 Ω72 than the Ω336 Ω43's they Ω328-ed, because their Ω340's are Ω341's, not Ω342's. By Ω343, Ω100Λ's Ω339 Ω183 Ω72. But Ω307. Ω308 and Ω320 of R Ω339 Ω183 Ω323 Ω72 than the Λ's they Ω328-ed, because their Ω344 Ω340's are Ω342's, not Ω341's. Ω345's Ω346 to the Ω141 (2023) Ω261 Ω33 as the Ω347 (Ω348, Ω349, Ω107 Ω350) Ω33, Ω41-ing that the Ω33 is Ω144-ly Ω351-ed on these Ω352's. These Ω352's are non-Ω353; they Ω354 Ω294-Ω355, as Ω356-ed to Ω294-Ω357. To be Ω358, the R Ω287 Ω359's Ω53's in non-R Ω352's, such as Ω360, Ω361, and Ω362. But as the Ω33 Ω363's Ω364-ly Ω365-ed, the R Ω287 is Ω364-ly less about Ω53 and Ω364-ly about non-Ω353 Ω366. The Ω146: The Ω146 is the Ω367 Λ of the Ω368 Ω369's. The Ω146's Ω258 is to Ω370 the R Ω79 and Ω33 Ω371. To this Ω372, it Ω373's to Ω78 Ω138, Ω370 Ω163 Ω153, and Ω374 the Ω117 of R Ω375's. It does this by Ω145-ing Ω123 Ω124's; Ω376-ing the Ω40 Ω377 (by Ω378-ing and Ω379-ing Ω380's); and Ω381-ing R Ω79's, including the Ω117 of Ω382 Λ's. In Ω145-ing Ω123 Ω124's and Ω376-ing the Ω40 Ω377, the Ω146 is obviously Ω383-ing Ω384 Ω385's of the R Ω287. The Ω146 is therefore a R T Ω386—a Ω387-ly Ω388 one in Ω229. But unlike other T Ω386's, it is itself a Ω389 in the R Ω287. The Ω146 Ω378's and Ω379's Ω226's, including Ω238's, sometimes in Ω390 to Ω383 and sometimes in Ω390 to Ω391 Ω392 for itself. No other T Ω386 Ω298's Ω238 or indeed has Ω393's of any Ω394.


Also, many of the Q's that the R S's themselves T to the U R V and are therefore themselves de facto W's of the R. Q of X is a Y Q, as is Z.Γ. Δ member Q Θ's Λ Ξ's to the R. Moreover, each Y Q's Π's are S-ed by the R. The R has the Ρ to Σ the Τ of a Q of whose Φ's it does not Ψ. This also Ω's that the R is itself a part of the Ω2's that it Ω3's. The R also Ω4's Ω5 to Ω6 Ω7's. Ω8 owns approximately 88 Ω9 U R Q Ω10's, this being 43% of the Ω11. Ω12 Ω13 Ω14 owns 60 Ω9 Ω10's, or 30% of the Ω11; and Ω15 Ω16 owns 8 Ω9 Ω10's, or 4% of the Ω11. The Ω17 of the Ω10's are Ω18-ed among the Ω17 of the Ω19's Ω20 Q's. This Ω21's how Ω22-ed the R is with the very Ω23's it is Ω24-ed to Ω3. Given that three Q's own over 75% of the R's Ω10's, it must be Ω25-ed: Do these Q's Ω26 the R? At the very least, they have a great Ω27 of Ω28 over it. At best, the R has a Ω29 Ω30 of Ω31; at worst, it has no Ω32 Ω33 from the Ω34 Q's that own it. Either Ω35, its Ω36 to Ω3 is presumably Ω29-ly Ω37-ed. In any Ω38, the R's Ω39 as a Ω40 Ω41 is Ω42, since unlike every other Ω43 Ω40 Ω41, it is partly Ω44 up of the very Ω23's that it is Ω24-ed to Ω3. Ω45-ing the Ω39 of Ω43 Ω46 and Ω47 in Ω48 Ω49: Because of its Ω42 Ω50 to the Ω43 Ω51, the U R must be Ω52-ed separately from other Ω43 Ω40 Ω41's. We will therefore Ω53 by Ω52-ing R-Ω54-ed Ω46; then we will Ω52 non-R-Ω54-ed Ω46; then we will Ω55 in on the Ω56 of the Ω57-ing Ω58. Ω43 Ω46 (of the non-R-Ω54-ed Ω59) has Ω60 a great Ω27 of Ω61 and very little Ω62; and Ω43 Ω47, as well as an Ω63 of Ω43 Ω46, have Ω60 a great Ω27 of Ω62 and very little Ω61. The 1929 Ω64 was Ω65-ed by an Ω63 of Ω46. In the Ω66 of the 1929, Ω67's were Ω68-ed, and there were Ω64's so long as these Ω69-ed Ω70. These Ω67's were Ω71-ed in mid-90s, and in 2000 the so-Ω72-ed "Ω73 Ω74" Ω64 Ω75-ed--the worst Ω64 since 1929. Between 2000 and 2003, the Ω76 (Ω77 Ω78 Ω79 Ω80) Ω81 a 20% and the the Ω82 Ω81 80%. No new Ω67's of any Ω83 were Ω68-ed in the Ω66 of this Ω64 and no Ω84-ing Ω67's were Ω85-ly Ω86-ed. In Ω87, there was Ω88-Ω89 Ω47. To Ω90 the Ω91-ing Ω5 Ω92 and the equally Ω91-ing Ω93, the R Ω94-ed Ω95 Ω96's. Presumably as a Ω97, the Ω5 Ω92 Ω98-ed for the next few Ω99's. But in 2008, the so-Ω72-ed "Ω43 Ω100" Ω75-ed. Between 2008 and 2009, both the Ω82 and the Ω76 Ω81 40%. This Ω101, there was a Ω85 Ω40 Ω102: Ω103-Ω104 was Ω68-ed, which Ω105-ed some of the Ω67's that had been Ω71-ed in the mid-1990s. To Ω90 the Ω106-ed Ω93 and Ω5 Ω92, the R Ω107-ed Ω95 Ω96's to near Ω108. This Ω65-ed a Ω109 Ω5 Ω92 Ω110 and temporarily Ω111-ed the Ω93. But by 2022, Ω108 Ω95 Ω96's had Ω112 to Ω109 Ω113. To Ω114 Ω113, the R Ω115-ed Ω95 Ω96's, which Ω116-ed the Ω5 Ω92---fourth worst Ω64 in the last 100 Ω99's-and Ω29-ly Ω117-ed down the Ω93. Thus, in the 25 since post-1929 Ω43 Ω67's were Ω71-ed, the worst three worst Ω43 Ω64's have Ω118-ed. The first two were Ω119-ly Ω120's of Ω47. The Ω73 Ω74 Ω64 was a Ω120 of Ω109 Ω121 Ω122 in Ω123 Ω124 Ω7's, which was Ω125 only because, thanks to Ω47, there were Q's large enough to Ω126 such Ω127. The 2008 Ω100 was a Ω120 of Ω128's Ω129-ing Ω130 Ω131's of Ω132, much of it Ω133-ing to Ω134's, in Ω135 Ω136's. As for the 2022 Ω64, that is not in any Ω137 Ω35 a Ω120 of Ω47. Arguably, it is a Ω120 of Ω46 since it is in part a Ω120 of the R's Ω138-ing Ω95 Ω96's. Does this mean that Ω43 Ω46 is a Ω139-ed Ω140 or does it rather mean that what the R is Ω141-ing isn't really Ω46? To Ω142 this, let us say a few Ω143's about the R. The R's Ω39 in Ω48 Ω43 Ω49: We only have Ω101 take a Ω144 Ω145 at the R's Ω146 on the Ω43 Ω147. Plus, because the R is so Ω22-ed in so many Ω35's with the Ω43 Ω147, it is inherently Ω148 to know what its Ω146 on it is. But that Ω146 certainly Ω149's to be Ω150. The R was Ω151-ed in 1913, supposedly with the Ω152 Ω153-ing the Ω154 of Ω155 and other Ω43 Ω64's. By all Ω156's, it Ω157-ed to do this. The 1929 Ω64 was by far the Ω20 that had ever Ω118-ed in the Ω158 Ω159's. The R may not have Ω65-ed the 1929 Ω64, but it didn't Ω160 it. At the same Ω101, the R did have a Ω161 in Ω162-ing the Ω163 Ω164. The Ω165-ed to the 1929 Ω64 by Ω166-ing Ω167 Ω168, Ω169-ing that it Ω44 Ω170 less Ω171, not more. Its Ω172 was that the Ω93 was Ω173-ing a "Ω174 Ω175" that shouldn't be Ω176-ed with. The Ω57-ing Ω164 Ω177-ed Ω178's of Ω179 Q's, Ω180-ing a relatively Ω181 Ω182 of relatively large Q's, in which Ω43 Ω183 was now Ω184-ed. It can reasonably be Ω25-ed whether this, given that the R is and always has been privately Ω185-ed, its Ω186's being large Q. Because of the Ω187 Ω155 Ω67's that were Ω188 in Ω189 in the Ω66 of the 1929 Ω64, the next 60 Ω99's or were relatively Ω100-Ω190. By the mid-1990s, these Ω67's had been largely Ω191-ed, a Ω120 of which was that the Ω192 Q's were now Ω193 than ever and could Ω194 more freely than ever. In the 1990s, the R Ω195-ly Ω196 Ω95 Ω96's, Ω197-ing Q's Ω198 to Ω199-ly large Ω131's of Ω170, which they Ω200-ly Ω201-ed, Ω202-ing the Ω73 Ω74 Ω100. The R's Ω102 to this Ω100 was to Ω107 Ω95 Ω96's even further, which Ω112 to Ω200 Ω122 on an even Ω203 Ω204, Ω202-ing to the 2008 Ω100. The R's Ω102 to this Ω100 was Ω107 Ω95 Ω96's even further, this Ω101 almost to Ω108. This Ω112 to Ω205 Ω113, to Ω206 which the R Ω207-ed Ω95 Ω96's in 2022, Ω202-ing to the third Ω20 Ω5 Ω92 Ω64 since the Ω163 Ω164. The R, so these Ω87's Ω208, is in the Ω209 of Ω210-ing Ω211-Ω126-ed Ω100's. The 1929 Ω64—which the R did nothing to Ω212 and may even have had a Ω161 in Ω162-ing—Ω213-ed Ω214 Ω167 Ω168, but the R Ω165-ed with Ω215 Ω167 Ω168, which Ω112 to the Ω163 Ω164. In the mid-1990s, the R had a Ω214 Ω167 Ω168, which Ω112 to the Ω73 Ω74 Ω64. The R Ω165-ed with even Ω216 Ω167 Ω168, which Ω112 to the 2008 Ω100. The R Ω165-ed to this with still Ω216 Ω167 Ω168, which Ω112 to the 2022 Ω64. We cannot Q's to Ω211-Ω3, and we therefore cannot Ω217 the R to Ω211-Ω3 to the Ω218 that it is Ω185-ed by Q's. Therefore, to the Ω218 that the R is Q-Ω185-ed, those Q's are presumably under-Ω3-ed; and when the R's Ω168's Ω219 the Ω43 Ω147, it is Ω220 because of an Ω63 of Ω43 Ω46. Therefore, given only that the R's Ω221 has often Ω222 the Ω43 Ω147, it doesn't Ω223 that Ω43 Ω46 sometimes Ω219's the Ω43 Ω147; if anything, what Ω223's that is that its Ω63 does so. V. Ω224  
In the Ω158 Ω159's, Ω43 Ω46 has Ω60 more Ω61 than Ω62. To be Ω225, no Ω46, no Ω226 how Ω227 or Ω228, is Ω119-ly Ω229. But where the Ω158 Ω159's is Ω230-ed, Ω231 to have been about as Ω119-ly Ω229 as Ω67's can be. Ω46 has Ω232-ed Ω43 Ω100's, and its Ω63 has Ω65-ed them. Moreover, Ω43 Ω46 has Ω60 nothing to Ω233 Ω234 Ω235. If anything, it has Ω60 the Ω236. During Ω237's of Ω238 Ω43 Ω46, the Ω93 Ω239 both quickly and steadily. During Ω237's of little Ω43 Ω46, the Ω57-ing Ω43 Ω64's Ω112 to Ω234 Ω240's, sometimes Ω241 Ω242's. Ω243's of Ω43 Ω47 typically Ω244 that they are Ω245-ing "the Ω190 Ω92." According to this Ω172, the Ω190 Ω92 Ω246's to Ω247, and Ω46, Ω248-ing Ω43 Ω46, Ω249's the Ω93, Ω202-ing to Ω250. Some Ω67's do indeed Ω251-ed the Ω93,  but some Ω212 it from being Ω251-ed. Ω252's Ω253 down when Ω198 to Ω170 is Ω254-ed. When Ω43 Ω92's are un-Ω3-ed, Ω170 is Ω255-ed and Ω198 to it is Ω254-ed. In the Ω158 Ω159's, Ω43 Ω67's have Ω256-ed Ω198 to Ω170. The Ω67's Ω257-ing Ω258 Ω155 Ω256-ed Ω155 and therefore Ω256-ed the Ω36 to Ω259 Ω132. By Ω260-ing Ω261 and Ω122 Ω155, Ω262-Ω263 Ω256-ed Ω198 to Ω170: it Ω232-ed Ω122 Q's from Ω129-ing with Ω134 Ω264's and it therefore Ω265 those Ω264's in the Ω161's of the Ω266's. By Ω256-ing Ω198 to Ω170, Ω43 Ω67's in this Ω267 have Ω265 the Ω93 Ω268-ing; and Ω43 Ω47 has Ω269-ed the Ω93 by Ω255-ing Ω198 to to Ω170. Thus, even by the Ω270's of a Ω271 Ω190 Ω272, Ω43 Ω46 has been a Ω273. In Ω224, Ω43 Ω46 Ω60 more Ω61 than Ω62 in the Ω158 Ω159's, and the Ω274's to the Ω275 not only Ω276 but do so on their own Ω277's. Ω278
