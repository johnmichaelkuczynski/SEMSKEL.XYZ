(It isn't K-ed unless it's B-ed and it isn't B-ed unless it's a P.) One can be A of non-P's, e.g. R's, T's, F's, but one does not in the J sense K them. Rather, one K's V's about them. K vs. A
  K is W-ly X-ed A. In order for me to K that my S's are Y-ly Z, I need to have the W's S, Z, Y, etc. I do not need to have these W's---or, arguably, any W's---to be A of the Y Z in my S's. My K of that V is a W-ation of my A of that M of N's. To put it another way: There are two L's of A: P-al and O-al. My H I of the D in front of me is a case of O-al A, as is my A of the Z of my S's. My K that there is a D in front of me is a case of P-A, as is my K that my S's are Y-ly Z. C vs. G U
   C U is different from G U. Given that x is a T, it is G-ly U that x have three E's. Given that x is an I-C that was just Q-ed on a very Ω Φ, it is C-ly U that x begin to Δ. The W of Θ
   One M of N's e is Θ of another M of N's e* iff (if and only if) e and e* are C-ly Λ-ed in such a way that, if one K's of e s Ψ, one has Ξ to B in e* Ψ. If one K's that Smith is Σ-ing up Ω1 Ω2, one has Ξ to B that Smith has a Ω3 Ω4. Therefore, Smith s Σ-ing up Ω2 is Θ of Smith s having a Ω3 Ω4. C Ω5's, Ω6-Ω7-ing Ω5's, and Ω8-Ω9-ing Ω5's

  S is a C Ω5 if S consists of Ω10's e1 en such that, for any i (1?i?n), ei is the Ω11 of ei+1;
A Ω6-Ω7-ing Ω5 if e1 Ω12's its Ω6 to en;
An Ω8-Ω9-ing Ω5 if a Ω6-Ω7-ing Ω5. Ω8-Ω13 is Ω6-Ω14. When you Ω15 on the Ω16, the Ω6 of the Ω17's you make is Ω18-ed into Ω19 Ω20's. The other F s Ω16 Ω21's those Ω20's into Ω22 (Ω6-Ω23) Ω17's. The second Ω17-Ω24 therefore Ω25's Ω8 about the first. Ω8? Θ
All Ω8 is Θ, but not all Θ is Ω8. The Ω26 s Ω27-ing at the 5th Ω28 is Θ of somebody s Ω29-ing a certain Ω26- Λ-ed Ω30. But neither Ω10 Ω25's Ω8 about the other, owing to the fact that, since they have different Ω6's, the first didn t Ω12 its Ω6 to the second. Ω8-Ω13 as the Ω31 of K
  Our Ω32-Ω33's are Ω34's of the Ω35's they Ω36: the latter Ω12 their Ω6's to the former. A Ω33-like Ω37 is Ω38, and therefore a Ω39 Ω40 Ω33, just in case it Ω41's its Ω6 from its Ω35, and Ω42 to the Ω43 that it does so. It is only to the Ω43 that our Ω32-Ω33's, Ω44-ed both Ω45-ly and Ω46-ly, Ω41 the Ω6's of their Ω47 Ω48's that our Ω33-Ω49-ed B's are Ω42. It is only to the Ω43 that our B's are Ω50-ed by Ω8-Ω51 Ω5's to the Ω52-ing Ω53's that those B's are K. A Ω54-Ω49-ed B is K only if the Ω54 in Ω55 is Ω56 of an Ω8-Ω51 Ω57 to the Ω58 in Ω55. A B Ω49-ed on the Ω54 of a Ω59 F is K, so long as the Ω54 in Ω55 was Ω8-Ω51. A B Ω49-ed on the Ω54 of an Ω60 F is not K unless the Ω54 in Ω55 was Ω8-Ω51. A B Ω49-ed on an Ω61 Ω62 (e.g. a Ω63 that often Ω64's) is K, so long as, in the J Ω65, the Ω62 was Ω8-Ω51. A B Ω49-ed on a Ω66 Ω62 (e.g. a Ω63 that seldom Ω64's) is not K unless, in the Ω65 in Ω55, the Ω62 was Ω8-Ω51. The Ω67 between a Ω63 that seldom Ω64's and one that often Ω64's is purely Ω68. The same is true of the Ω67 between a Ω69 who seldom Ω70's and one who often Ω70's. The Ω67 between K and mere B is not Ω68. A given B is K exactly if it is the Ω71-Ω72 of an Ω8-Ω51 Ω5, it being Ω73 how other B's Ω74. Ω75 the Ω76 of Ω77 Ω78
  For one Ω10 e to Ω79 another Ω10 e* is for there to be a Ω80 C Ω81 Ω82-ing with e and Ω83-ing with e*. For e and e* to be Ω84 is for there to be no such Ω81. Ω85 the Ω76 of Ω75 and Ω8-Ω13
Ω86's are Ω87's of their Ω11's. An Ω10 Ω12's Ω8 about its Ω11 to the Ω43 that the former Ω41's its Ω6 from the latter and, therefore, to the Ω43 that the latter's Ω6 is C-ly Ω88 of the former's. When the Ω11-Ω86 Ω89 Ω7's Ω6 that is, when Ω8 is Ω12-ed--- it is because Ω90 Ω91 C Ω92's are Ω7-ing their Ω93 Ω89's. When a Ω94- Ω95 of someone s Ω96 is Ω12-ed, without Ω97 of Ω98, from one Ω99 to another, each of the Ω96 Ω100's Ω36-ed Ω101's its own C Ω5 and the Ω93 Ω89's of those Ω102 C Ω5's are Ω7-ed. Consequently, Ω65-Ω103 K of C Ω104's isn t Ω105-ed to Ω106 the Ω107 of the Ω11 from the Ω107 of the Ω86. But just such Ω108 Ω109 K is Ω105-ed to Ω106 that somebody Ω29-ed the Ω110-Ω30 from the Ω111-ing of the Ω30. K is Ω112-ly Ω113-ed through Ω8-Ω13 Ω5's---our Ω114's Ω41 their Ω6's from our Ω33's, which Ω41 their Ω6's from the Ω52-ing Ω53's. On the Ω31 of this K, we can Ω113 K of non-Ω8- Ω51 Ω115 Ω89's. But K of the latter L presupposes K of the former L. Chapter 2 Ω116, Ω117, and the Ω118 Ω107 of Ω119 K

Ω120 and Ω121 Ω122
Given two P's P and Q, P Ω123's Q iff Q is a G Ω124 of P. If P Ω123's Q, then, if P is true, it follows that Q is true and therefore that Q may be Ω125-ed from P. If a given F Ω125's Q from P, and he does so on the Ω31 of his K that P Ω123's Q, then that has F has made a Ω126 Ω121 Ω122. Ω127 and Ω128 Ω122
P Ω129's Q iff P, Ω130-ing it true, Ω131's the Ω132 that Q is true. Given only that P Ω129's Q, it doesn't follow that Q may be Ω125-ed form P. There are three Ξ's for this. First, if P Ω129's Q, P may also Ω129 not-Q. P: Smith is an Ω133 Ω134-Ω135. Q: Smith Ω136's of a Ω137, not of Ω138. R: Smith Ω136's of Ω138, not of a Ω139-Ω140. Q is Ω141 with R. P Ω129's each, and we may Ω142 for Ω143 Ω144's that it Ω129's each Ω145-ly. Therefore, given P, it doesn't follow that Q may be Ω125-ed and it doesn't follow that R may be Ω125-ed. (Nor does it follow that Q or R may be Ω125-ed, given P may be Ω129 P's Ω141 with each other Q and R.)
  Also, given only that P Ω129's Q, it doesn't follow that P, Ω130-ing it true, makes it Ω146 that Q is true. What follows is merely that, because P is true, Q is more Ω146 than it would otherwise be. P: Smith is Ω147-ly Ω148. Q: Smith will Ω149 a Ω150 for Ω138. P Ω129's Q, since the Ω151 of Q, given P, is Ω152 than the Ω151 of Q, given not-P. But the first Ω151 is still very Ω153. Therefore, P does not by itself Ω154 Ω155 of Q. Third, Ω130-ing that

(i) P is true;

  (ii) P makes it Ω156-ly Ω146 that Q; and
  (iii) P doesn't Ω145-ly Ω129 some Q-Ω141 P R; nonetheless,
(iv) Q still cannot be Ω125-ed from P. This because there might be some true P R that, when Ω157-ed with P, Ω158's
Q. Consider:
  P: Smith is an Ω147-ly Ω159 F who very much Ω160's to become a Ω161 and is about to get his Ω162 from a Ω163 Ω164 Ω165. Q: Smith will be a Ω166 Ω167. R: Smith's Ω168 is about to be Ω169-ed over by a Ω170 who Ω171's to Ω172 the Ω173

of Ω164. Ω130-ing that P Ω129's Q, Q may Ω126-ly be Ω125-ed from P if, and only if,

   (a) The Ω174 that P is true and Q is false has Ω175 Ω176 Ω124's than the Ω174 that P and Q are both true,

and

   (b) The Ω174 that P is true has Ω175 Ω176 Ω124's than the Ω174 that P is false. If a given F Ω125's Q from P, and he does so on the Ω31 of his K of each of (a) and (b), then that F has made a Ω126 Ω128 Ω122. Four Ω177's of Ω178
(i) Ω120 is Ω179: if P?Q, and Q?R, then P?R. P: Smith has over 20 Ω180's. Q: Smith has over 15 Ω180's. R: Smith has over 10 Ω180's. (ii) Ω127 is not Ω179: If P Ω129's Q, and Q Ω129's R, it doesn t follow that P Ω129's R. To wit,

P: Smith is a Ω181 who is Ω182 to be Ω183-ed in 20 Ω184's and whose Ω185 Ω186 is such that, if a Ω187 Ω188 who didn't K about Smith's Ω189 were to Ω190 Smith, that Ω188 would give Smith at least another Ω191 to live. Q: If a Ω187 Ω188 were to Ω190 Smith, he would Ω192 that Smith would not Ω136 a Ω193 Ω194 for at least nother Ω191. R: Smith will live at least another Ω191. (iii) Ω120 is Ω195: If P?Q, then, for any R, (P and R)?Q. P: Smith has over 20 Ω180's. Q: Smith is from Sudan. R. Smith has more than 10 Ω180's. (iv) Ω127 is non-Ω195: Given only that P Ω129's Q and that R is true, it doesn t follow that P and R Ω196-ly Ω129 Q. P: The Ω197 is Ω198-ed. Q: The Ω197 Ω199's. R: The Ω197 is Ω200. Ω120? Ω201 Ω127

If P Ω123's Q, then, Ω130-ing that P is true, there is a 100% Ω151 that Q is true. But Ω120 is not Ω201 Ω127. Ω120 is a G Ω202. Ω127 is an Ω203 Ω202. For P to Ω123 Q is for P and not-Q to be Ω204. For P to Ω129 Q is for P and not- Q to be Ω205. A given P is Ω204 if its very own Ω6 Ω206's it from being true. A given P is Ω205 if, given the Ω207 Ω208, the Ω174 that it s true has more Ω176 Ω124's than does the Ω174 that it s false. Ω127-Ω89's non-O-al in Ω107
Ω127 Ω89's, though not themselves C Ω89's, sometimes hold in Ω209 of
C Ω89's. P: Smith Ω135's 10 Ω210's of Ω211's every Ω212. Q: Smith has Ω152 Ω213 Ω214. P Ω129's Q, the Ξ being that Smith s Ω135-ing so much is Ω215 to Ω11 him to have Ω152 Ω213 Ω214. But neither P nor Q is a Ω11 or an Ω86, and P s Ω129-ing Q therefore isn t an Ω216 of Ω75. Ω118's
A Ω118 is a Ω217 of the Ω218: if P, then Q. An Ω219 of a Ω118 is:

(1) If Smith has more than 100 Ω220's, then Smith has more than 50 Ω220's. Ω221's Ω222-ing with Ω223's like  Ω130-ing that,   Ω224-ing that,   since,   given that,   on the Ω186 that,  and  because  are also Ω118's ( since/Ω224-ing that/given that/on the Ω186 that Smith has more than 100 Ω220's, he has more than 50 Ω220's ). These Ω225's are not all Ω226, but the Ω227 (Ω228-Λ-ed) Ω67's between them are not Ω229 in this Ω65.


L's of N often X-ed by U G's
   (1) R's a S P. It is a S P and therefore, if T, a S T. L's of N V to be W-ed by G T's; and they V to be W-ed by Y's to the Z that each M of an A B C of D's is T. E the L that:

(2) F H's when I-ed

(2)  s J is K L-ed by the Y that:

(3) M-ed any N x, if x is O-ed of F, then x H's when I-ed. (3) does not Q of any one N that it H's when I-ed. (3) R's an S C of N's; for it Q's that, for any N A,

(4) If A is O-ed of F, then A H's when I-ed. Thus, whereas (1) T's you to U only about V, (3) T's you to U about W. M-ed any F N, (1) T's you to Q that it will H if I-ed. And M-ed any N it at all, (1) T's you to Q of that N that

(a) It would H if it were F;

or X-ing that it is in Y F but that it isn t being I-ed, that

(b) It will H if I-ed;

or X-ing that it is being I-ed and is O-ed of F, that

(c) It is H-ing because it is F that is being I-ed. The Z of A L not B-ed to C or even D N's
  Thus, L's of N have a E F of Z. They are not G-ed to this or that N; they H with I to S C's of N's; and, what is J, those C's sometimes K L D N's. In M, many L's of N H only with I to C's all of whose M's are L D (N-ing that, in O, they don't have M's but could have M's). For P,

   (5) An N Q's no R's in S or T if the U's V-ing on it W each other out. Further, many such L's H with I to C's whose M's are X-ed by the L's of N themselves from Y-ing. For P,

(6) An N Q's no R's in S or T if no U's are V-ing on it. In M, L's like (6) are Z AA, since they AB AC D's in E's of which C D's are to be F-ed. Even though the L's of N G the H of an N's on which no I U's are V-ing, it is only to the J that a K-ed N s L M's to that of such an N that it is S- and T-N. O of the P Q with O of R S

  (11) M-ed that Z s (QQ-RR-SS-ed and therefore P to me) AA-BB CC is DD-ing, it TT's to UU that it was VV WW-ed from an n ?32 JJ. Three XX's of P's
  Among the YY ZZ's in which AAA BBB's can be P, three are of CCC DDD. First, they can be P to a K-ed EEE, in a K-ed FFF, GGG-ing to the HHH that, in that FFF, the III (JJJ-KKK-ing) LLL's that MMM between NNN's and otherwise P BBB's have been OOO-ed. (Cf. the AA-BB CC that is in the QQ RR. Any PPP-QQQ's RRR-ing off of it are SSS-ed by the TTT UUU's of that RR before they can VVV you.)
  Second, they can be P because they are too WWW to XXX or otherwise YYY, even though, K-ed the ZZZ AAAA, e.g. a BBBB of the ZZZ CCCC, they could be YYY-ed. (Cf. DDDD's, EEEE's, and FFFF's.)
  Third, there are some AAA BBB's which, for GGGG's of A L, could not HHHH be YYY-ed, no IIII how JJJJ KKKK LLLL-ed. (Cf. MMMM's, NNNN OOOO's.)

The PPPP QQQQ of A L
   RRRR's SSSS to TTTT A L's on the UUUU of which they can, when K-ed VVVV- S WWWW, XXXX T Y's as to T, Y, or D ZZZZ of that VVVV as well as other VVVV's. L's vs. S T's
   Any AAAAA that BBBBB has in a K-ed CCCCC is DDDDD to its AAAAA in the EEEEE's in E's of which that CCCCC is to be F-ed. The FFFFF doesn t GGGGG whether he is HHHHH-ing this as IIIII-ed to that JJJJJ/KKKKK/LLLLL, except in so far as the one JJJJJ/KKKKK/LLLLL MMMMM's G EEEEE's/A L's not MMMMM-ed by the other. L's sometimes X-ed by NNNNN- and OOOOO-PPPPP T's
   Some QQQQQ's of BBBBB have RRRRR the SSSSS  G EEEEE  to TTTTT  UUUUU VVVVV EEEEE,  and they have thus RRRRR the WWWWW that the L's of N must be UUUUU VVVVV. A EEEEE/L is  UUUUU VVVVV  if, K-ed any two XXXXX's of YYYYY-OOOOO, it H's no ZZZZZ for the one than the other. But many of the AAAAAA-BBBBBB's on which RRRR's CCCCCC are DDDDDD, and therefore neither T nor EEEEEE, for almost all XXXXX's of YYYYY-OOOOO. M-ed that you are FFFFFF, it can be GGGGGG-ed that you will HHHHHH IIIIII if you JJJJJJ KKKKKK, but not that you will LLLLLL into MMMMMM NNNNNN if you OOOOOO PPPPPP. QQQQQQ,

(a) x is FFFFFF?x is KKKKKK-RRRRRR

is a SSSSSS TTTTTT of UUUUUU, whereas

(b) x is FFFFFF?x is PPPPPP-RRRRRR

is not a SSSSSS TTTTTT of UUUUUU. But even though the C of YYYYY-OOOOO XXXXX's in which there are VVVVVV is a WWWWWW XXXXXX YYYYYY-C of the ZZZZZZ C of YYYYY-OOOOO XXXXX's, and even though, AAAAAAA, the C of YYYYY-XXXXX's with I to which (a) is BBBBBBB-CCCCCCC T is DDDDDDD XXXXXX, (a) is EEEEEEE FFFFFFF in the GGGGGGG HHHHHHH as a IIIIIII-JJJJJJJ of a L, such as

(c) KKKKKKK LLLLLLL the MMMMMMM of NNNNNNN. Each of (a) and (c) OOOOOOO's PPPPPPP's and QQQQQQQ's; (b) does not RRRRRRR so, and neither does an SSSSSSS, TTTTTTT NNNNN- and OOOOO-VVVVV, G, such as

(d) KKKKKKK in any XXXXX of YYYYY-OOOOO that is O-ed of UUUUUUU VVVVVVV WWWWWW's XXXXXXX n oz.,

for an YYYYYYY ZZZZZZZ of n. The AAAAAAAA between (a) and (c) is one of BBBBBBBB: (a) is CCCCCCCC DDDDDDDD than (c) and (a) also has ZZZZZ Z than (c). But with those EEEEEEEE's, (a) s QQQQ in the FFFFFFFF of O is GGGGGGGG to (c) s QQQQ: each HHHHHHHH's as a G on the UUUU of which S IIIIIIII's can be JJJJJJJJ-ed. This cannot be KKKKKKKK of (b) or of (d). In LLLLLLLL to MMMMMMMM the NNNNNNNNN of the OOOOOOOOO, we must PPPPPPPPP the QQQQQQQQQ at our RRRRRRRRR; and in LLLLLLLL to PPPPPPPPP the QQQQQQQQQ at our RRRRRRRRR, we SSSSSSSSS to TTTTTTTTT EEEEE's, such as (a), that are of UUUUUUUUU Z and are only DDDDDDDD T. VVVVVVVVV WWWWWWWWW that, were there ever KKKKKKK XXXXXXXXX to YYYYYYYYY about the OOOOOOOOO, there would be no ZZZZZZZZZ for AAAAAAAAAA-BBBBBBBBBB G's like (a). But were that CCCCCCCCC DDDDDDDDDD, there won t be any SSSSSSSSS for BBBBB; and so EEEEEEEEEE as it isn t DDDDDDDDDD, FFFFFFFFFF but GGGGGGGGGG G's, like (a), are to be HHHHHHHHHH-IIIIIIIIII-ed with FFFFFFFFFF, JJJJJJJJJJ-GGGGGGGGGG G's, like (c), i.e. they are to IIIIIIIIII-ed as L's of N. Also, that CCCCCCCCC cannot HHHH be DDDDDDDDDD. With every KKKKKKKKKK in our O, there is a LLLLLLLLLL in what there is to YYYYYYYYY about the OOOOOOOOO, K-ed that any K-ed MMMMMMMMMM of O is no ZZZZZ a NNNNNNNNNN of the OOOOOOOOO than is a OOOOOOOOOO or a PPPPPPPPPP. Therefore, QQQQQQQQQQ's to RRRRRRRRRR up the

SSSSSSSSSS's in our O of the OOOOOOOOO TTTTTTTTTT new such SSSSSSSSSS's, it being the UUUUUUUUUU of BBBBB, not to VVVVVVVVVV such SSSSSSSSSS's, but to WWWWWWWWWW their XXXXXXXXXX and to YYYYYYYYYY the Z of those cannot be VVVVVVVVVV-ed. ZZZZZZZZZZ G's have a AAAAAAAAAAA UUUU
The AAAAAAAAAAA between

(a) x is FFFFFF?x is KKKKKK-RRRRRR

and

(b) x is FFFFFF?x is PPPPPP-RRRRRR

is not to be F-ed in BBBBBBBBBBB E's. While it is CCCCCCCCCCC a CCCCC that 100% of FFFFFF DDDDDDDDDDD's are KKKKKK RRRRRR, whereas only a XXXXXX EEEEEEEEEEE are PPPPPP RRRRRR, this isn t the GGGGGG that (a) is, whereas (b) is not, a L. It is FFFFFFFFFFF in what it is to be GGGGGGGGGGG FFFFFF (or otherwise HHHHHHHHHHH) that a FFFFFF DDDDDDDDDDD be KKKKKK RRRRRR. The GGGGGG that no one is KKKKKK-IIIIIIIIIII is that a EEE s being KKKKKK-RRRRRR is JJJJJJJJJJJ-ed in his KKKKKKKKKKK a LLLLLLLLLLL HHHHHHHHHHH GGGGGGGGGGG XXXX- up. And if a K-ed EEE MMMMMMMMMMM to be KKKKKK-IIIIIIIIIII, he would be so NNNNNNNNNNN his being GGGGGGGGGGG FFFFFF. It V's that if OOOOOOOOOOO MMMMMMMMMMM to be KKKKKK-IIIIIIIIIII, while otherwise being GGGGGGGGGGG just like C FFFFFF DDDDDDDDDDD's, each EEE would be KKKKKK- IIIIIIIIIII NNNNNNNNNNN his being GGGGGGGGGGG FFFFFF; and it therefore V's that, under such PPPPPPPPPPP's, each and every MMMMMMMMMM of KKKKKK-QQQQQQQQQQQ, though BBBBBBBBBBB RRRRRRRRRRR, would in SSSSSSSSSSS a TTTTTTTTTTT. By the GGGGGGG UUUUUUUUUUU, if OOOOOOOOOOO MMMMMMMMMMM to be PPPPPP-RRRRRR, while otherwise being just like a GGGGGGGGGGG RRRRRRRRRRR FFFFFF DDDDDDDDDDD, VVVVVVVVVVV of these MMMMMMMMMM's of PPPPPP-WWWWWWWWWWW would be JJJJJJJJJJJ-ed in what it is to have a LLLLLLLLLLL FFFFFF XXXXXXXXXXX.

Unless you are V-ly W-ed, for your X A to remain Y-ed is not for you to undergo no X B's. For the C's D to remain E is not for the various F's G-ed to undergo no B. It is for the B's that they are constantly H-ing to remain within certain I's; it is for those B's to remain such that their mean J K doesn't B. Unless their mean J K is zero---and even then---this means that those L M's are constantly N-ing about. For there to be a B in the C's D is for there to be a B in the O of B P of its having a given D. Q-ing that the C's D at a given R is 78?, for the C's D to S is for there to an S in the T of the various F-U's P of the C's being 78?; and for the C's D to V is for there to be a W in the T of such U's. The same thing mutatis mutandis holds with respect to B's in your X-ical A. So-called B's typically identical with meta-B's
  An Y is a B. Therefore, all Z's and all Z*'s are B's. But we take for granted, and thus cease to be aware of, the occurrence of the B's P of stable A's; and we thus tend to reserve the use of the word 'B' for B's in O's of B. If the AA's AB-AC, AD-AE AF, etc. are stable, the AG-ing AH will tell his AI that 'there are no B's to AJ', his meaning that, whatever the AA's A was, the B's P of his being in that A have remained within certain I's. An AK says that 'there has been no B' in the AL if the O's of AM and AN P of a AO's AL haven't B-ed. An AP AQ AR's no B in the C's D if there has been no D-AS B in the O of F U's G-ed in the C's having that D. AT, AU, and AV
  AW AX AY's us to AZ past Y's and to BA future ones, and it thereby AY's us, within I's, to AV the BB of Y's. Q-ing that BC is some BD-BE for some BF that you have, you know how to BG your BH-A (you should take BC); you can AZ why your A BG-ed (you took BC); and you can AZ why your A BI-ed (you stopped taking BC). Stable-Y O's a BJ for AT-BK
   In BL's in which there are stable O's of Y's, it tends to be BM to AZ, BA, and AV what happens; and it tends to be BN to do so in BL's in which there are no such O's and which therefore consist of BO Y's. It is BN to BA what will happen to a 10 BP BQ of BC that is being BR about by BS BT's; it is BU BV to BA what will happen such a BQ is BW-ed by someone with the BX-ed BF. It is for this BY that AT and AU almost always consist in the BK of BZ-Z's. Given some Y CA, CA's BZ-Z is a CB or stable A that, although not by itself CC of CA, CD's the occurrence of some CB-CE CF Y CA-1 that is thus CC. The CG Z of CH's getting CI-ed is CJ's CK for CL. The BZ-Z is the CM CN A of CH's CO: since that CO is CP, it is CQ that somebody will CR somebody's CS-CT's in some way or other. The AK is right to CU the CI-ing on the CV's of CW. The CX is right to CU the CI-ing on CJ's CY of CZ's. The AK has correctly DA-ed the BZ-Z of CH's CI-ing; the CX has correctly DA-ed the CG Z. DB on DC in DD to the DE of DF DG
   DB DH says that, if a given DI BC DJ's to a given DK DL M, four different DM's of Z's are likely to be DN:

(1) BC's DO (how BC was before he was DP-ed with M);
  (2) M's CF Z (the DQ that, though it did not itself DR for BC's DJ-ing to M, made it CQ that the DS-est DT in BC's A would thus DR);
  (3) M's DU Z (some DQ DV-ed by BC, e.g. a DW DX-up, that is DN DY of (2) and isn't P of BC's DO);
(4) The CG or DZ-ing Z of M (some CF Y, e.g. the EA of a EB EC-ing, that ED's BC, who has thus far been on the EE that EF's those who EG from BC from those who don't, just past that EE). DK EH
DB says that DF Y's are often 'EH-ed. What does DB mean? The EI EJ is: A given Y, e.g. x's EK-ing in EL with y, is EH-ed iff that Y has EM EN DN EO Z's. An Y's CG Z is not EP of its BZ-Z; nor is it EP of any one of its non-CG Z's. An EQ of this ER of EH: x ES's in EL with y because of y's ET as well as y's EU's; and each of these EV's was so EW that, had the other one been EX EY, it would by itself have DR-ed for x's EK-ing in EL with y. But even though this is a ER of DC EH, it isn't the DM DB has in EZ. FA, as before, that x ES's in EL with y, both because of y's EU's and because of y's ET, but that, were x ET but not FB-FC or vice versa, x would not have FD in EL with y. Under those FE's, DB would still say that x's EK-ing in EL with y was EH-ed. When DB says that a given DK Y e is 'EH-ed,' he means that it was FF about by the FG of two or more DK Y's each of which FH-ed e's occurrence. FI to any one such Y, e's occurrence made FJ, even though not a single one of those Y's was FK FL on its own of FF-ing about e. Thus, if DB was right, as he FM was, DC in the DK FN often FO's the FP-ing of EE's: it isn't FQ that x have just one FR for EK-ing in EL with y; unless he has FS FR's, nothing happens; but once FQ such FR's FT, the FU FV's and x ES's in EL with y. EE FW's and the FX-FY FZ
   GA GB's tend to FC EE FW's. A GC GD doesn't do anything until there is GE-GF, at which GG it GH's off the GI GJ in GK. A GL doesn't GM GN until it's in the GO by a certain GP, at which GG it GQ's the GR GS. GT GB's don't FC EE FW's. To the GU that the GV GB's GA-ly, it has a FY GW, and to the GU that it GB's GT-ly, it has an FX GW. An FX GX is one that GB's GT-ly with the GY of R; a FY GX is one that GZ-ly GB's HA's at HB-ed HC's. Z's as HD-HE's (HD =HF, non-HG, HH, EO)

FA that

e (CH's HI-ing the HJ)

is the Z of

e* (the HK's HL-ing on),

but that e* was not EH-ed e*, i.e. that e* wouldn't have HM-ed unless e had HM-ed. By itself, e HN isn't EO for e*. If the HO's are HP or the HQ is HR, e will not HS about e*. But given that e* did happen, it HT's that there was some FG of Y's/A's that HU-ed for e*; and given that under the DN FE's e* would not have HM-ed unless e had HM-ed, it HT's that e is a non-HG HV of that FG of Y's. That FG of Y's, though EO for e*, wasn't HW for e*: after all, an EX HX FG of Y's---one not HY-ing my HI-ing the HJ or any of the Y's HZ-ing between my IA-ing so and the HK's HL-ing on could have IB-ed the HK
to HL on. It HT's that e was an HF but non-HG HV of a A that HH but EO for e*'s occurrence that, in other IC's, that e was an HD HE for e*. In
[3]most ID

(i) Such and such was the Z of thus and such
means
(ii) Such and such was an HD HE for thus and such. IE IF's
IG's of the ER if P had been the IH, then Q would have been the IH are
IE IF's (or IE's). Thus, the II of

   (1) If IJ hadn't been IK-ed, the IL would have IM-ed out of IN IO before 1965

is

(1*) IJ's IP IQ-ed a pre-1965 IR-IS. IT-ly, the II of

(2) If CH hadn't IU out of the IU, he wouldn't have IV his IW

is

(2*) CH's IU IB-ed him to IX his IW. Thus, many IE's are to the IY that one thing IB-ed another to happen and many IE's therefore IZ in JA of JB-JC's of the DC JD. But some IE's IZ in JA of JB-JC's, not of the DC, but of the JE JD. For JF, the II of

(3) If, at R t, CH had had over $10, then, at R t, he would have had over $5,

is

(3*) CH had over $10 at t' JG's 'CH had over $5 at t. Thus, all IE's JH the JI of JJ's of JK of some DM or other, and all therefore IE's therefore IZ in JA of JB-JC's of one DM or other. In this JL, we will JM JN-ly on IE's of the DC JD. JO JP's JQ of IE's
JR to JO JP (1972, 1984), the II of (1) is

(1#) If w is a GV in which IJ was not IK-ed but is JS as much like our GV as that JT JU's it to be, then in w the IL IM-ed out of IN IO before 1965. JP's JQ is JV. Any given Y has JW DC JX's. IJ's IP was the JY of a FG of JZ, DK, and KA Y's, and each of those Y's is in its KB a JY of some other FG of Y's, and so on. This means that if IJ's IP doesn't take KC in a given GV, then either

(a) That GV KD's so much from our GV that it is no KE that IJ even KF's in it, let alone KG's an KH IR-IS

or

(b) That GV KD's from ours in respect of the KI KJ's HY-ed in it,

  Given either (a) or (b), there is KK or no KL that, in the GV in GK, IJ KG's an KH IR-IS. So JP's JQ is false. Also, it is by KM-ing the DC and JE GW of our GV, not other GV's, that we know whether or not a given IE is true. This means that IE's IZ in JA of the JE and DC GW of our GV, as KN to other GV's. Since there is no BY, KO from JP's JQ, to KP that there are other GV's, it HT's that there is no BY at all to KQ their JI or therefore to KR JP's JQ.


Q-R

  Because the S in the T is V-ing, S-U's W the X Y's of the T with so much Z that the T Ω's. Let c1 cn be those Λ-Φ Π's. The S's V-ing did nothing in the Ψ of Ω-ing the T except in so far as it was Γ for c1 cn. Nonetheless, for Δ's having nothing to do with our not Θ-ing about those Σ Ξ-Π's, the Κ answer in some Μ's to the Ν  why did the Y's of the T Ω? is  because the S inside the T was V-ing,  and not  because c1  cn occurred. Ceteris paribus the T would have Ω-ed even if c1 cn hadn t occurred, since the Ρ's in Ν Λ-ed the occurrence of some such Ξ-Π's. Given that the cause of an event is what Λ's its occurrence, the V-ing of the S is, insofar as it Λ-ed the occurrence of the Τ's of c1 cn, Κ-ly Η-ed as  the cause  of the Ω-ing of the T. Α Β in relation to counterfactuals
(i) c1 cn caused the T to Ω
is true. But

(i*) if c1 cn had not occurred, then the T would not have Ω-ed
is false. If c1 cn had not occurred, other Ξ-Π's would have occurred that would have Ω-ed the T. In general, where there is Α Β, Α truths cannot be converted into counterfactual truths. Suppose it a truth that

(A) The J died because K W-ed it. If the J was otherwise un-Χ-ed, then a consequence of (A) is
(A*) If K hadn t W-ed it, the J would not have died. But if K was part of a Ι of Ε's, each of whom would have W-ed the J had K not done so, then (A*) is not a consequence of (A). The Counterfactual Analysis of Causality (CAC)
According to CAC, the meaning of

(#) e is the cause of e*

is

(#*) If e hadn t happened, then e* wouldn t have happened. The motivation for CAC
Ordinarily the meaning of (#) is taken to be

(#^) e Φ-ed e* to occur, i.e. e s occurrence Ψ-ed e* s occurrence. Some Υ's and some Ω's have argued that there is no Λ (Σ) evidence of the existence of Ξ's. This being their position, they have two options. Option #1: Take the deeply Π Ρ that there is no Σ support for any Α claim. Option #2: Hold onto the Τ that Α claims are often Σ-ly well- supported but reinterpret those claims in such a way that their Ψ isn t predicated on the existence of (supposedly) un-Θ-ed Ξ's. CAC is meant to provide one such way of reinterpreting Α claims. CAC evaluated

Two Ν's must be asked in connection with CAC? First, is it Δ-ly correct? Second, is it Γ-ly correct? A theory is Δ-ly correct if there are no counterexamples to it. A theory is Γ-ly correct if, first, there are no counterexamples to it and, second, the reason there are no counterexamples to it is that it is a correct description of what it's supposed to describe. Γ correctness entails Δ correctness, but not vice versa. Suppose I put forth the following theory: There will be at least 10 Μ's of Ο in Olin 310 on Thursday, and the reason for this is that the invisible and otherwise undetectable Π who lives in my Ρ will Σ-ly transport at least 10 Τ's into Olin 310. Given that, as it happens, there did turn out to be more than 10 Μ's of Ο in that place at that time, this theory is Δ-ly correct, meaning that there are no counterexamples to it; but it is Γ-ly incorrect, meaning that, even though the Φ's are consistent with it, they are consistent with it for the wrong reason. CAC is Δ-ly false. For

(#*) If e hadn t happened, then e* wouldn t have happened

is not always consequence of

(#) e is the cause of e*. (#*) fails to be such a consequence whenever e is but one of many would-be causes of e*, and it therefore fails whenever Ψ's Q for e* s occurrence. CAC is also Γ-ly false. Suppose it true both that

(A) The otherwise un-Χ-ed J died because K W-ed it

and also consequently that

(A*) if K hadn t W-ed it, the J would not have died. If it weren t for (A) or for some other Α claim, there would be no justification for (A*). Another example:

 (I) Because the Ζ Η was Β-ed onto the Θ Ι, the Η turned into a Ζ. Supposing that no other person or Ξ would have Β-ed the Η onto the Ι, a consequence of (I) is
(I*) If the Ζ Η hadn t been Β-ed onto the Ι, it wouldn t have turned into a Ζ. But whereas one can reasonably accept (I*) on the basis of (I), one cannot possibly accept (I) on the basis of (I*): knowledge of (I*) is necessarily Κ of knowledge of (I), suggesting that the truth affirmed by (I) is more Λ than the truth affirmed by (I*). This suggestion is consistent with the Φ that, whereas (I*) is a consequence of (I), (I) is not a consequence of (I*). Explanation: Given only that the Η would not have turned into a Ζ had it not been Β-ed onto the Ι, it follows that its being Β-ed on the Ι was in some way or other Μ of its turning into a Ζ. But given only that the Η turned into a Ζ because it was Β-ed on the Ι, it does not follow that the Η wouldn t have turned into a Ζ had it not been Β-ed on the Ι. If the Η was in a Ζ Ν-ed T which suddenly Ο-ed up, then it would have turned into a Ζ without being Β-ed onto a Ι. CAC Defended (CACD)

  Here is the one and only way in which advocates of CAC can defend their position against the just-made Π's: Once again suppose that

(A) the J died because K W-ed it. If K Ρ-ed and K s Ε Σ Τ took the opportunity to W the J Υ, the effect of Τ s W-ing the J would have been different from the effect of K s doing so. Depending on whether it is K or Τ who W's the J, the J dies at this as opposed to that time; the Φ W's the J at this as opposed to that Χ; the Ψ-ed J Ω's this as opposed to that Ξ as it falls to the Γ, where it lands in this as opposed to that location, at this opposed to that exact moment in time. In general, supposing that e is the cause of e*, it is only if e is Δ-ly Θ-ed that (#*) if e hadn t happened, then e* wouldn t have happened
fails to be a consequence of (#) e is the cause of e*. Problems with CACD
There are three problems with CACD. These have to do with

(i) Events whose causes involve the exceeding of Κ's,
(ii) Events whose causes are Λ's that can be implemented in different ways, and
(iii) Events whose causes Q for their occurrence. (i) Explained

  At time t, I Μ the Ν and the Ο Π's as a result. Had I not done so, someone else might have Μ-ed the Ν at t and the Ο would still have Π-ed, and the result would have been the same: the Ο would have Π-ed at the same time, in the same way. Of course, there is little Ρ that this other person would have Μ-ed the Ν in the exact way that I did: he would have used either more or less Σ than I did, and his Τ wouldn t have come into Υ with the exact same Φ's of the Ν as my Τ. But this is irrelevant. The Ν is a Χ-Λ. When the Ο Π's isn t a Ψ of the way in which the Ν is Μ-ed, and neither is the manner in which the Ο Π's. Thus, had some other person Μ-ed the Ν, the result would have been the very same event that resulted from my Μ-ing the Ν. Therefore CACD is false, given that, according to it, the (Ω) event resulting from the other person s Μ-ing the Ν would not have been Ξ-ly Γ with the (Δ) event resulting from my Μ-ing it. In general, the identity of a given Κ effect is not Θ on the Σ composition of its antecedents. Thus, where Κ effects are concerned, there is genuine Α Β, and CACD is therefore false. (ii) explained

  I Ι  1+2=  into a Κ; then I hit ENTER. My hitting ENTER caused a  3  to appear on the LCD. But if I hadn t hit ENTER, the  3  still would have appeared, since my Λ Μ would have hit ENTER had I not done so. Had Μ hit ENTER, he would almost certainly not have hit it with the same Ν of Σ or in the same manner, a likely result being that the Ο Π precipitated by his hitting ENTER would have differed in some Ρ's from the Ο Π precipitated by my hitting ENTER. But so long as Μ didn t Τ the ENTER Υ with excessive Σ or otherwise cause the Κ to Φ, those differences wouldn t have caused a different Χ to be carried out (they wouldn t have caused 50 to be divided by 5); nor would they have caused the same Χ to be carried out in a different way (they wouldn t have caused the Ψ to add them in Ω 3, as opposed to Ω 10 or Ω 2). Thus, the differences between the Μ-caused Ο Π and its JM-caused Ξ led to no differences between the Μ-caused Γ Π and its JM- Ξ. Since the Μ-caused Γ Π did not otherwise differ from its JM-caused Ξ, the former is Δ-ly Γ with the latter. Since the Μ-caused Ο Π did differ from its JM-caused Ξ. And since the JM-caused Γ Π was Γ with its Μ-caused Ξ, that Γ-Π was in each case distinct from the Ο Π that Θ-ed it. In general, Γ-Κ Π---meaning, ultimately, any Α-Λ that can be implemented in different ways---is to be distinguished from the event-Λ by which it is implemented, notwithstanding that the two Λ's are Μ-ly Ν. In general, the identity an event that can be implemented in different ways isn t Θ on its exact composition or, therefore, on the exact composition of its cause. Thus, where such events are concerned, there is genuine Α Β, and CACD is therefore false. (iii) Explained

   A Ο Ι converts Π Ζ-Η into a Ρ Ζ. Let m1 mn be the Σ of Τ-events that is immediately Γ for this conversion process. Given that the Η was on a Ο Ι, it was Υ that some such Τ-events occur, even though it obviously wasn t Υ that those Σ Τ-events occur. Therefore, if m1 mn hadn t occurred, the conversion-process still would have occurred, thanks to some entirely distinct Σ of Τ-events m*1 m*m. The conversion process precipitated by m1 mn has a different Φ composition from the
Ω conversion process precipitated by m*1 m*m. But just as the identity of a Χ Χ isn t Θ on the exact identities of the
Ψ's who are carrying out the Ξ s Δ's, so the identity of the conversion-process in Ν isn t Θ on the identities of the exact Τ-Κ's that happened to be immediately Γ for it, a consequence being that the Ω conversion-process is Δ-ly Γ with the Δ conversion-process. Therefore CACD is false, given that, according to it, the (Ω) conversion-process would not have been Δ-ly Γ with the (Δ) conversion-process.


In general, the X of an Y whose Z P's for it is not Q on its R S or on the T X of its U V's. Thus, where such Y's are W, there is X Z Y, and CACD is therefore false. Z of our W of The Q X of Z (CAC)
According to CAC, e is the Z of e* iff e* wouldn t have X had e not X. F s P's that CAC is false. His Y: My X-ing the Z is the Z of the Y s X-ing, but the Y might have X even if I hadn t X the Z  somebody else might have X it. Therefore, CAC is false. Y's to X F s Z are false. Therefore CAC is W false, and not merely prima facie so. Chapter 4 The Y X of Z

The Y X of Z X

  According to H, e1 is the R Z of e2 iff any Y that is S to e1 T U to an W V Y that is S to e2; and e1 is the R Z of en iff, for each i (1?i?n), any Y that is S to ei T U to an W V Y that is S to ei+1. H P's that, if e is the R Z of e*, then there is a X to the Y that any Y
S to e is U to an W V Y that is S to e*. H therefore P's that X's are Y's and Z W's are X's of such Y's. H therefore X's the Q Y, according to which X's are Z's that are W for such Y's and are therefore R from them. H therefore X's the Q Y, according to which Z's are W for their Y's and are therefore not merely their V's. Thus, in H s view, X's are Y's and Z-W's are X's of Y's. H s Y for this X (first version)
  P's H (I am X-ing): If there is any R (S) T for X-ing that e X e*, it is

  (i) The Y that e was e* s U V and W, X with
  (ii) The Y that Y's S to e are always the U V's and W's of Y's S to e*. H s Y for this X (second version)
Let e and e* be two Y's such that:

e is Z with A s X-ing with hitherto R B, and such that
e* is Z with B s thereupon X to Y. And let e-e* be the Z X-ing of e and e*, in that order. e-e* is a P-case of a Q Z. Let us X that each of e and e* was X by W R Y, whose X's were therefore W T. It is X that e X e* to Y and that its X-ing so X more than its W X-ing and being U to e*. But no such X was X. This is not the relevant Y-Z's were W. It is because there are no X's to Y. The Z X in H s X Part 1
  H s X of Y, and his Z of it, X a Y to Z some of the most R S's about the Y. In this X (Part 1), we will X those Y's. In the next (Part 2), we will Y why they Z a X of H s Y. There are two Z's of Q Y's:

(i) Those that X Y's

and

(ii) Those that X solely of Y's of Z. An Y of (i) would be a Z (e.g. a X Y, a Z Y) that X's off of a Y. An Y of (ii) would be a Z that doesn t X with anything or otherwise Y Z-X-ing Y's with other Z's. Such a Z s X of Y at time t is a Q Z of its pre-t X of Y; the Z s Y at t is a Q Z of its pre-t Y; any given Y about the Z s R X at t is the Y of the Z s pre-t X. Following Bertrand Russell[4], we will X to type-(i) Z as  transeunt  Z and to type-(ii) Z as  immanent  Z. Anything that X's for any Y of time is a Z of Y's of W X and is thus a Q Z: a Z of X's of Y's such that any given such X, apart from the last, is the Z of a W S such X and any such X, apart from the first, is the Y of a S such X. The Z's of X-time are Q Z's. The Y between W and X Z is that W Z is, whereas X Z is not, Y-Z-ing. The X-Y Z in the W is a Y-Z-ing Q Z; so is the X that was just Y at it. When the X Y's with the Z, these two Q Z's X, and the Y is a Q Z that is not Y-Z-ing. The X and the Z X upon Y; so their respective Z's were thereby X. Any given case of X Z involves the Y of a Z-W-ing Q Z. Ball A X's with hitherto R Ball B; A P's X-ing and B Y's X-ing. Even though each Z has X its Y, neither Z s X has X its Y. By virtue of X-ing A and X-ing B, the Y X a Z, W X in the Y of Q-Z X of their respective Y. The Z Y's are  W  and  X. Z's that are not X upon sometimes Y and therefore Z their X. But such Y Z's are W. A X-ing Y-Z X's its Y in a W X, its Y of Z being a X of W X. An Y-Z that is X by a Y Z's its X in a W X, its Y of Z being a X of Y Z. There are obviously W X many Y's of Z X. But the Y Z of such Y's is zero. (A X Y can be zero even if the corresponding Z is not zero.) This is because any Y of X Z is a Y---a Z of

the X Y's of Z Y's that X the Y's of the Z-time Y. Any case of X Z is a Y of Z X. Y Z involves not only involves a Z, but a X, of Y Z's. The Y of Z X is the W Y of Z-X Y-Z's. The Z X in H s Y Part 2
  The X of Y Z is W. The X of Y Z is W. A X is that the Y has a Z X to the Y that it Z's Y's of X Z, and an Y Z to the X that it Y's Z's of W X. A X-Y, Z's of W X's. (The first Y Z's; then the second one Z's; and so on.) The X of a Y doesn t have such a Z; nor does the X Y of a Z X, such as a Y-Z. Neither such Z consists of W, X Y's of Z's. A fortiori neither Z X's of Y's whose Z X's to each other have to be X. All Y's of Z are Q Y's, but no such Y Z's of W X's whose Z Y's to their X's need to be X. Z Y's are X only when they re Y, and they re Y only when Z's have been X. H P's it for X that all Y's of Z are Z with such X's, and H therefore P's it for X that those Y's per se are non-Z. When X-ing to Y for an Z of X Y, the Z X is to Y to Z what has been X. (When two Y's X, Z Y is X.) The Z X is to Y for a Z underneath the X's. (It s precisely because A s Z Y X's to Y W that each Z s X of Y X's.)
  Because H P X's of Z X as Y's of such X, he X Z to be a Y between Z X's. This in turn X him to X the Y's of Z on which he X: it X him to Y on the Z's in which the Y was Z from the X and to Y the Z's in which the Y was W with the X. The Z X in H s Y Part 3: The X of a H-Y and its Z in the X of Y-ing H s Y

H P's that there is no R S for X-ing
(a) e X e* Y
to

(b) e*-S Y's always X W V X-ing e-S Y's. H s Y for this Z
  An Y exactly like e could W X and be Y Z with an Y that it did not Z but was otherwise exactly like e*. For example: X's underneath the Y on which A is X-ing Z it to Y at the exact Z in which it X's Y with B, whereupon those same X's Z B to Y X-ing. Further, those X's Y the Z's of X of A and B in exactly the Y in which, in Z, the X Y their Z's of X. There is no Z Y between this W X, on the one hand, and the Z X, on the other. What is more, in the W X, the Y was had nothing to Z with the X Y's in the Z's  respective X's of Y, and there was therefore no Z X between the Y and the X-Y's to be X. Given that the Z and the W X's are Y Z, it X's that no Z X Y-ing Z and Y can be X in the Z X. Given any Y of Z, a S X P's that it is Y Z from a non-Z Y-X. Thus, even though the W Z's of Y's can obviously be X, their X-ing as Z's cannot be X. H Y's Y Z from their non-W X's
  But the W X in Y is Z Y, in many X's, from the Z one. If X's are Y for Z W X's, there will be Y Z of that X. That Y may not be Z on the X on which you Y the Z's X, but that is Y. If A X for no Y at all---if it was Z X that its Y-ing into X with B X at the same time as its X-ing to Y--- the X will be Y very Z from one in which its X-ing to Y was a X of its Y-ing into X with B. In the one case but not the other, A and B will be X in Y Z's, they ll X Y's in Z, their X's of Y will Z, and so on. These Y's won t be Z to the X Y, but that X's only that H s Y of the Z P's, if at all, only with respect to an W X of it. In general, X Z Y's are Y Z from W-Z Y's. And what X Y's is that the Y's X-ing a Z W X are Y with each other, whereas those Y's X-ing a W-Z X are merely Y with each other, Y's are Z with their X's, and not merely Y with them. In the X in which the post-Y Z X's Y by A and B are the X of Y-Z-ing X, there is a Y Z of which B's X-ing is a Y and there is also a Z X of which A's X-ing to Y is a Z, but there is no W X of which both are Y's.


But there is such a Q in the R in which the S is in T U for the V-ed W by A and B: those V-ed mediate a X Y of Z (M x α), much as V in β O-γ mediate the δ-ing of O. These ε suggest that the θ of ι is κ: a X λ-μ is a ν Q; a ξ λ-μ is a π-ν Q, even if every π-ρ σ of that τ is υ with its φ and every π-χ σ is υ with its ψ. If this is ω, then whenever we Ω a Q to be X, we are Ω1 Ω2 Ω-ing Ω3 of Ω4 to be ν-ly U for other Ω3 of Ω4. Three Ω5 Ω6 to the Ω7 Ω8 of ι
Ω9 #1: The Ω10 Ω11 is to be Ω12-ed in Ω13 of the ν Ω11, not Ω14 Ω15. Ω16's Ω8 Ω17-s Ω18 and is therefore Ω19-ly Ω20 and therefore Ω21. Ω9 #2: Ω22 is not ι. A Ω23 of Ω16 s Ω8---indeed, the very θ of it---is that Ω22 is ι. Therefore, Ω16 s Ω8 is Ω21. Ω9 #3: Given any Ω24-ly Ω25 λ, e and e*, there is some Ω26 of which that λ-τ is an Ω27. Ω16 s Ω8 therefore Ω28-s that any two Ω24-ly Ω25 λ are Ω29-ed as Ω30 and Ω31. Since this isn t the R, Ω16 s Ω8 is Ω32. Ω33 of Ω9 #1
   There is no Ω34 to Ω35 Ω36 Ω37 or Ω38 to λ except on the Ω39 of their ν Ω40-Ω41. e is Ω42 with e* iff there is no ν Q that Ω43-s with the one and Ω44-s with the other; and Ω45-s e* iff either

(i) e Ω46-s e* (e.g. there is a ν Q, such as a Ω47 Ω48, that Ω43-s with e and Ω44-s with e*)

or

(ii) There is some λ that is Ω42 with e that Ω46-s e*. e is Ω49-ly Ω25 with e* iff either

(a) They are π-Ω42 and the one can Ω50-ly Ω46 the other

or

(b) They are Ω42, and therefore cannot Ω46 each other, but there is some λ e# such that each cannot Ω50-ly Ω46 e#. Ω51 Ω52-ed that the Ω53 of Ω50 "Ω54 at a Ω55" is Ω56. He was Ω57. If there is no Ω58-Ω59 between Ω30 and Ω31, there is no Ω55 between Ω30 and Ω31, the Ω60 being that for there to be either a Ω49 or Ω10 Ω61 between Ω30 and Ω31 is for that Ω27 of ι not to be Ω50. Ω62 about Ω24 Ω40-Ω41 have neither Ω63 nor Ω64 Ω65 unless Ω66-ed as Ω62 about ν Ω40-Ω41:

(1) e Ω45-s e*, but e doesn't Ω46 e* or anything Ω42 therewith,
which Ω67-s


(2) e is no Ω68 of the Ω69 of the Ω58-Ω70 Ω71-ed by e*,

which Ω67-s

(3) e does not Ω45 e*,

which Ω67-s
(4) e and e* are Ω42 Ω72 of some one Ω49 Ω73, but neither can Ω46 anything Ω46-ed by the other,
which Ω67-s

(5) At no Ω74 in Ω58 is there any Ω75 of Ω76 whose Ω69 or whose Ω77 Ω78-s both e and e*,

which Ω67-s

(6) e and e* do not Ω42-ly Ω79 some one Ω49 Ω73. Ω80 about Ω24 Ω40-Ω41 are therefore Ω80 about ν Ω40-Ω41, and the Ω24 Ω11 is to be Ω12-ed in Ω13 of the ν Ω11. Ω16 Ω17-s Ω18, and his Ω8 is therefore Ω32. Ω33 of Ω9 #2
  Ω81 A Ω82-s with Ω81 B and B Ω83-s as a Ω84. This is Ω85-ed on Ω86; a Ω87 is Ω88-ed out of this Ω89; the Ω87 Ω90-s of Ω91 Ω92 of the same Ω89---of A Ω93-ing and thereby Ω94-ing B. In this Ω95, whenever there is an Ω96 of A Ω93-ing B, there is a Ω97, Ω24-ly Ω25 Ω96 of B Ω83-ing. But the A-Ω96 isn t for the Ω97 B-Ω96: there is a Ω98 that Ω99-s there to be an A-Ω96 and also Ω99-s there to be an Ω100 Ω97, Ω25 B-Ω96. This Ω98 is U for each Ω96. The A-Ω96 Ω101 Ω102 is no more Ω103 of Ω104-ing a B-Ω96 than a Ω105 of one Ω106 Ω107-ing another can be U for the Ω108 Ω106 s Ω109. But a Ω23 of RA is that Ω96-A is U for Ω96-B. Therefore, RA is Ω32. The τ Ω110-ing of those two Ω96 is an Ω27 of Ω111 ι. Ω111 ι is not Ω112 ι; it is Ω113-ι. e is the Ω111 Ω30 of e* iff

(i) Any e-Ω114 λ is Ω100 Ω115-ed by an Ω25 e*-Ω114 λ,
(ii) e is not the Ω30 of e*, and
(iii) The Ω30 of each of e and e* is some Ω116 ν Ω117 e#. Ω118 Ω119-s with Ω27 of Ω111 ι. If a Ω120 is Ω121-ed in Ω122 O, the Ω123-Ω124 of the Ω125 of Ω126 Ω100 Ω45-s an Ω25 α of the Ω127 Ω128-ing the Ω129 of the Ω120. But the Ω130 is not the Ω30 of the Ω131; the Ω30 of each is the T that the Ω120 in Ω122 O. The T that the two λ are Ω24-ly Ω25 has to Ω132 with the Ω133 of the Ω120, Ω134-ed with the T that Ω135 Ω136 have Ω135 Ω137 of Ω138. When my Ω139 is Ω140-ing on, a Ω141-ing Ω142-Ω143 Ω144-s on the Ω145: each Ω142 Ω144-s Ω100 before an Ω25 Ω142 and the Ω146 of Ω142-Ω147 Ω148-s a Ω143. No two of those Ω147 are Ω29-ed as Ω30 and Ω31; each Ω142 is Ω149-ed by Ω150 Ω151 Ω152 that also Ω149-s a Ω153 Ω142. According to RA, each Ω142 is the Ω30 of its Ω100 φ. A Ω142-Ω147 in a given Ω154 is always Ω100 Ω115-ed by an Ω25 Ω142-Ω147. Therefore, RA Ω28-s that Ω153 Ω142 are Ω29-ed as Ω30 and Ω31. Therefore, RA is Ω32. Ω139 are Ω155-ed in such a Ω34 that Ω156 ν Q are Ω157-ed by Ω113-ν ν Q. Ω158 Ω159 Ω160 are Ω161 of Ω150 Ω151 Ω152. Ω151 λ that are Ω29-ed as Ω30 and Ω31 Ω149 Ω159-λ that Ω162 to be Ω29-ed as Ω30 and Ω31 but are not so Ω29-ed. These Ω159-Ω147 are Ω158 Ω163 of Ω18 Ω150 Ω151 Ω152, and because we can be Ω164 these Ω159-Ω147, by Ω164-ing the Ω165 Ω166-ed therein, we are Ω167 to Ω164 the Ω168 Ω150, and Ω18 Ω169-Ω167, Ω151 Ω152. In some R, a given Ω159-Ω147 is the Ω170 Ω30 of another such Ω147. Ω141-ing the Ω171 from one Ω154 to another Ω99-s it to Ω172 Ω173: the Ω174-Ω172 Ω175-s Ω176 Ω152 that Ω177-s about a Ω173-Ω172. But even this Ω178 of λ-τ is Ω179 with RA. Ω180-ing that a given Ω172 in the Ω171's Ω174 is Ω100 Ω181-ed by a Ω172 in its Ω173, the Ω174-Ω172 cannot Ω182 be the Ω170 Ω30 of the Ω173-Ω172: nothing can Ω182 be the Ω170 Ω30 of anything that Ω100 Ω181-s it. And since the Ω174-Ω172 Ω183 isn't Ω184 ν-ly

U for the Ω173-Ω172, there Ω185-s no ν τ of which both λ are σ. A Ω186 Ω174-Ω172 on the Ω68 of the Ω171 Ω175-ed the Ω176 Ω152 that Ω177-ed about the Ω187-Ω188-ed Ω174-Ω172 as well as the Ω97 Ω173-Ω172. Ω33 of Ω9 #3
  Ω66 the Ω186 Ω188-ed Ω142-Ω143. Let e be one of those Ω142; let e* be the Ω142 that Ω100 Ω181-s e; and let r and r* be the Ω189 Ω24 Ω190 of those Ω147. If k is the Ω191 of all Ω142 Ω192-ing in r, and k* is the Ω191 of all Ω142 Ω192-ing in r*, then any given k-Ω147 is Ω100 Ω181-ed by a Ω153 k*-Ω147. Given any λ E, there is some Ω193 K of which E is the Ω194 Ω27. It Ω181-s that, given any two Ω153 λ, there is some Ω26 of which that λ-τ is an Ω27. According to RA, any such τ is Ω1 Ω2 ν. Since this isn't the R, RA is Ω32. Ω195 5 ι to be Ω12-ed in Ω13 of the Ω196 of the Ω197-Ω198 Ω199 of Ω200 Ω33

The Ω197-Ω198 Ω199 of Ω33 (DN)

  According to DN, E is Ω201-ed iff, Ω180-ing that C is a Ω202 of the Ω203 in which E Ω192-ed and L is a Ω202 of the Ω204 Ω205 in C, then the Ω206 that E Ω192-ed is a Ω207 Ω23 of the Ω208 of C and L. Here are four Ω209 of DN-Ω210 Ω33:

Ω209 #1:
E: the Ω211 Ω212 Ω213-s at t*. C: the Ω211 Ω212 is Ω214-ed at Ω186 Ω58 t. L: Ω211 Ω213-s when Ω214-ed. C+L (C Ω208-ed with L) Ω207-ly Ω28-s E. Therefore, according to DN, the Ω33 of E is C+L. Ω215: This Ω216 Ω217-Ω218-s that the Ω58-Ω219 between t and t* doesn t Ω220 the Ω221; it Ω217-Ω218-s that nothing Ω222-s during that Ω223 that doesn t Ω224 the Ω211 Ω212 s Ω138. Given that there, for any Ω225 Ω58-Ω223, there is a Ω58-Ω219 between them, this Ω226 isn t always Ω227-ed. So, Ω228, C+L does not Ω28 E. Rather, C+L Ω28-s E on the Ω229 that nothing has Ω172-ed during the Ω58 that has Ω230-ed between t and t*. This is a Ω9 for DN and for RA. But, in the Ω231 of this Ω232, we will Ω17 that the Ω58-Ω219 between t and t* doesn t Ω88 a Ω233 and that the Ω221 Ω234-s through. This T about Ω209 #1 is Ω235 Ω236 Ω237 of each of the Ω238 Ω239 of DN. Ω209 #2:
E: x is Ω240-ing at Ω58 t*. C1: x was Ω241-ed in Ω242 of O y at t. C2: x s Ω243 Ω244-s y s. L1: a Ω245 Ω242 Ω246-ing in O (or Ω247 of any Ω248) Ω249-s a Ω250 of O whose Ω251 Ω252-s that of the Ω245 Ω242. L2 (a Ω253 of L1): A Ω245 Ω254 Ω246-s/Ω240-s in Ω247 b Ω255 if a s Ω243 is Ω256
than/Ω257 than b s. E is a Ω207 Ω23 of and, according to DN, is therefore Ω201-ed by---this Ω258-Ω259. Ω209 #3
E: The Ω260 at which x is Ω261-ing y is Ω262-ing Ω263-ly. C1: x s M is m and y s M is m*. C2: x and y Ω264-ly Ω265 an Ω266-ed Ω267. L1: the Ω268 Ω269 between two Ω242 is Ω184-ly Ω270 to their M and Ω271-ly Ω270 to the Ω272 of the Ω55 between them. L2 (a Ω253 of L1): Ω273 Ω274, the Ω268 Ω269 between two Ω242 not
only Ω262-s, but does so Ω263-ly, as they Ω261 each other. L3: (a Ω253 of L2): Ω273 Ω274, the Ω260 at which two Ω242 Ω261 each other not only Ω262-s, but does so Ω263-ly, as they Ω261 each other. E is a Ω207 Ω23 of---and, according to DN, is therefore Ω201-ed by this

Ω258-Ω259. Ω209 #4:
E: the Ω260 at which x is Ω141-ing around is Ω257 at t* than it was at Ω186 Ω58 t. (x is a Ω275 of Ω276 on the Ω277 of a Ω242 of O w.)
C1: w s Ω278 at t* is Ω257 than it was at t. C2: all other Ω279 have Ω280-ed Ω281 during that Ω223. L1: O Ω90-s of Ω280. L2: the Ω282 a Ω242 of O, the more Ω283 the Ω280 Ω284-ing it Ω83. L3: the Ω285 an Ω254 Ω83-s, the Ω257 the Ω286 it Ω287-s an Ω254 with which it Ω82-s, a Ω23 being that Ω273 Ω274 the Ω257 is the Ω288 by which that S Ω249-s the Ω289-ed Ω254. E is a Ω207 Ω23 of---and, according to DN, is therefore Ω201-ed by this
Ω258-Ω259. Ω9 with DN
  Ω204 are given by Ω206 that Ω290 Ω291. Ω262-ing Ω292-Ω278 Ω262-s Ω292-Ω250 is a Ω293 because, other Ω294 being Ω295, the Ω257 the Ω292 s Ω278, the Ω257 the Ω250 it Ω296-s. If the Ω292 is Ω297-ed to an Ω298 Ω299, and when for that Ω60 other Ω294 are not Ω295, then the Ω292 s Ω300 Ω250 does not Ω262 with Ω278.


What V-s is the Q of the R on the S-T-s. Hence the U: Q is directly W to X and inversely W to S-Y. But this U is obviously a Z of the first U that more X A-s to more B. For when the B-C is D-ed, it is E-ed by a Q on the R's F to let its B be C-ed. U-s, so G-s the DN-H, are I-ed by J-s of the K for any x, if x has phi, then x has psi. In other words, U-s (according to DN) are I-ed by L, M N-s. O vs. P N-s
But, as the DN-H Q-s, not all such L N-s R U-s. Cf. every S in my T is a U (for any x, if x is a S in JM's T, then x is a U). Not a U. Why not? The V (and obviously W) X: a Y's being a S in my T doesn't Z it to be a U or---to put it more accurately and also more generally---a Y's being a U doesn't A on its being a U. But the DN-H cannot B this C. Suppose that the D E F-s when G-ed is a U, whereas all the S-s in JM's T are all U-s, is that G-ing E Z-s it to F, whereas H-ing S-s in my T doesn't Z them I U-s. In that case, the J that E F-s when G-ed is a U is K on the J the J that E is already L to F when G-ed. If this J about E is not already L, then there is no more M to N E F-s when G-ed as a O N and, therefore, as P from an obviously P N, such as all the S-s in JM's T are U-s. Why this is a Q for DN: Suppose it L, before it's L that E F-s when G-ed is a U, that the D E R A is F-ing is that it's being G-ed. Suppose that, before this U is L, it's L for any a E R M, it is L that it's because M is being G-ed that M F-ing. In that case, the Z of M's F-ing is L and so therefore is the S for the J that it's F-ing. (The Z: M's being G-ed. The S: M's being G-ed.) To T the S is to T the Z. So in at least some U-s, E R x's F-ing is not to be V-ed in W of some X U; it is not to be V-ed in W of the U that E F-s when G-ed. On the contrary, that U is to be V-ed in W of the J that x F when G-ed. In Y, if the Z between O and P N-s is that the former have AA AB whereas the latter do not, then DN is AC-ed; for the AD of DN is that AE-s cannot AF be AG-ed, even AH, except in W of U-s. And this is indeed the Z between O and P N-s, and, consequently, DN is indeed AC-ed. How DN-H-s AI with the AJ between O and P N-s
  For this D, H-s DN do not AK the Z between E F-s when G-ed and all the S-s in JM's T are U-s is that the former is a AA AL, whereas the latter is not. They therefore have to AM some other AN AO Z between the two P-s. Hempel's AP (widely AQ-ed among DN-H-s, since they have no other AR) is this: whereas E F-s when G-ed AS-s AT-s, all the S-s in JM's T are U-s does not. It is not the AU that if a AV non-U-S were AW in my T, it AX into a U. By AY, it is the AU that, if AZ R x were BA-ed in BB of BC y, it BD-s that x would BE in y if x were BA-ed in y. Thus, a U is a N that AS-s AT-s. In this BF, DN has seemingly BG-ed itself against the BH that O P-s BI AA BJ-s and therefore against the BK BH that DN is BL to AK that S-s are BM BN U-BO and, in BP, against the BH that DN is BQ BL to BR that O BS-s (BS-s that BI U-s) are BT-ed by BU-ing BV BW-s of AA BX. DN BY BZ if it CA-s U-s to AS AT-s
  AT-s are CB P-s; to T Z-s is to T S-s; to V an AE is to CC its Z. Therefore, DN is CD of BY BZ in so far as its CE is CF-ed on U-s' being AT CG. S: Let L be the U the AZ BE-s.[5] Why does L AS AT-s? Because, if x is an CH CI of AZ, CJ-ing it in BC Z-s it to BE. Another CK: E F-s when G-ed (for any E R x, if x is G-ed, then x F-s.) This U[6] AS-s AT-s. Why? Because, given some CH E R x, x's being G-ed Z-s x to F. L N-s are P-s to the CL that each CM of a CN of P-s is CO, each such CM being a M CP (one of the K if P, then Q or therefore, CQ, of the K if x has phi, then x has psi). If a AV L N is to AS AT-s, and is thus, by Hempel's CR-s, to CS as a U, then each of the CT M-s must AS AT-s. But those AT-s AS M-s only if the CU CV is CW: CX that if A has phi, then A has psi is an CH one of those M-s, A's CY phi is CZ of A's CY phi; i.e. A's CY phi must Z A to have psi. If that CV isn't CW, then if A had phi, then A would have psi isn't CO, in which case for any x, if x had phi, then has psi is an P, not a O, N. DA, if for all x, if x has phi, then x has psi is to L to be a U, then we must T that a AV Y's CY phi Z-s it to have psi. So, if we are to T that for all x, if x has phi, then x has psi is a U, then we must T that, given some CH DB A of phi, A's being a phi is what is DC for A's being a psi. But if we T that, then we already have BX of at least S (DD, that A's being a phi Z-ed it to DE a psi). And while it may be that our BX of that DF DB of DG is BO on some other U L* (if x is phi*, then x DH-s into a psi*), DI DJ DK about the first U (if x is phi, then x DH-s into a psi) is DL CO of L*---and it is therefore CO of any U L** on which L* is BO, and so on. Since we must therefore DM DN to some U L# our BX of which is not DO of our BX of some other U; and since L#, being AT-CG, is to the CL that, for CH X, X's CY PHI is CZ of X's CY PSI (for some DP-s PHI and PSI); and since, by DQ of DR-ing of L# and ipso facto DR-ing that X's CY PHI is CZ of X's CY PSI, we already T how to V at least one Y (DD, X's CY PSI); it BD-s that S-s are not, at least not in Y, U-BO and, more DS, that they do not, at least not in Y, have the K to V E is to CC L U-s L1...Ln such that, if C1...Cm is a DT of the DU-s of E, then E is a DV DW of L1...Ln+C1...Cm. DX DN-DY BY BZ
According to Hempel, if we DZ to T that the EA EB-ed, we EC to T

(i) What the CV-s were that ED-ed EE to the EA's EB-ing,

and

(ii) What the EF U-s were in DQ of which those CV-s EG-ed to the EA's EB-ing. Some Q-s with this EH
  Let E be the EA-EB-ing in EI. CX that E EJ-ed at EK t, the EL "the CV-s that ED-ed EE to E" obviously doesn't EM to the EN of the EO pre-t EP. Less obviously, it doesn't even EM to some EQ ER the EP. Let R be a ES-EK ET EU-ing the EV-s of which E was a EW. Not DI in R was AN to E. The EX CV-s in R are EY; the EZ of the FA at the FB of R is EY; and so on. So when Hempel FC-s us that E is to be V-ed in W of "the CV-s" FD-ing it, what Hempel FE-s, FF it CO, is that the EA-EB-ing is a EW of the AN FG-s (e.g. the FH of the EA, the FI of the FJ-ed FA, the FK of that FA from the FL that is FM-ing it FN-ward, the FO of that FL). If C is one of E's FG-s, C is a AN FG only if C Z-ed E. [7] We can't FP a FQ-BN S of E unless we T, for each E's FR FT FG-s, whether or not that FG is AN to E; and if we T a AV FG C is AN to E, then we ipso facto T that C Z-ed E, and, since to V an AE is to CC its Z, we ipso facto have an S of E. Thus, in FU to FP a FQ-BN S of E, we must already have an S of E. An FV: "Suppose you T that C Z-ed E, but you don't T how C did so---you don't T what the FW U-s were. In that case, your BX of what it is that Z-ed E is FX. FY: For me to have a FZ-GA GB of why E EJ-ed, I do indeed T the how, and not just the what. For me to T why Smith is GC it is not GD for me to T what GE him GC (he GF GG GH); I also EC to T how his GI-ing GG GH EG-ed to his being GJ. But if I T, as I surely can, that Smith is GC because he GG GH, I surely do have BX of an S of his GK, even though that S is GL-GA. GM, if I T what EG-ed to the EA's EB-ing (it was GE of GN GO and there was a GP GQ GR-ed to it), I am surely GS of a W S of the EA-EB-ing. If T which U-s were GT-ed, then I surely have a much GU S of that GV AE: I have a GW S of that AE, whereas I GX did not. AA BX as GY BX
  GZ it was HA-ed HB that we HC to T of DF U-s of E's being G-ed and F-ing for that D before we T of the U in DQ of which G-ed E-s F: indeed, a HD for our DR-ing of such a U HC-s to be that we T of DF U-s of E F-ing in EW of being G-ed.


In Q to this, the R is S to be T-ed (and---though not as a Q to this very U---has been T-ed, V-ly many W's, by X's of DN, from Y to Z A):

(#) We B many C's of D E's being F-ed and then G-ing. We are H-ed. So we I a J K to the L that D M's when F-ed. Now that we (N we) O of this J, we are no longer H-ed. You P that we can't O of K's Q until we O of R S's of D E's G-ing in T of being F-ed. This is not U. We O of D E's G-ing upon F-ed. But until we O of K, we don't O that there to be a V-W X between those E's being F-ed and their G-ing. K is Y to the L that, for any D E x, x M's if F-ed. If K doesn't Z α's, it isn't a J. So K must Z α's. But if it Z's α's, K is a β γ (for any D E x, F-ing x δ's it to M). So let us ε, as we must, that K is a β γ. If our only ζ for η-ing that x M's when F-ed is that x θ M when F-ed, then in ι-ing a J to the L that they are β-ly κ-ed, all we are λ-ing is μ-ing: "It is so; for it must be so." In which ν, K doesn't really ξ anything. And in which ν, furthermore, there is ο π for K, a ρ being that K isn't really a J so much as it is a σ τ, which, being of υ φ, cannot χ as the ψ of an ω. By the same α1, if we have β1 ζ to γ1 K to be a J, we must have ζ to γ1, δ1-ly of K, that this ε1 ζ1 of D η1-ed because it was F-ed, the same being θ1 of that ζ1 of D ζ1, and also of that other ζ1 of D, and so on. How such ι1 is κ1-ed is made λ1 over the μ1 of the next ν1 ξ1's. ο1 as π1 ρ1

σ1's are usually τ1-ed by υ1-φ1's:

*The χ1-ψ1 ω1's on the α2 ψ1. *The β2-ψ1 ω1's on the γ2-δ2. *The one E's ε2 ω1's on its ζ2 and on the η2 of the E that θ2-ed with it. *The ψ1 in x's ζ2, ι2 to a κ2 with λ2 to which x is μ2-ing, ω1's on the ν2 of ε2. *The ξ2 to which ο2 x's π2 can be ρ2-n ω1's σ2-ly on the ξ2 to which its τ2 can be ρ2-n, and the ξ2 to which x's η2 can be ρ2-n ω1's σ2-ly on the ξ2 to which its π2 can be ρ2-n. *The ξ2 to which υ2 φ2's χ2 β2 ω1's on the ψ2 of υ2 ω2-n. *The ξ2 to which α3's β3 a γ3 ω1's on the ξ2 to which he δ3's them ε3. *The ξ2 to which ζ3 η3's to θ3 ω1's on the ξ2 to which ζ3 η3's to ι3-κ3's. *The ξ2 to which a γ3 λ3's μ3 ν3's of ξ3 on a π3 ο3 ω1's on the ξ2 to which he is π3-ing a ξ3 ρ3. *If a σ3 E is τ3-ed around one of its υ3 φ3's, the ξ2 to which it χ3's ψ3 ω1's σ2-ly on the ω3 of the E. A α4-ed β4 is that if a π3 γ4 (e.g. δ4) is ε4-ing on an E, it doesn't ζ4 that the E's η4 of θ4 ι4's or that the E otherwise ι4's. If another γ4,
e.g. an κ4 and λ4-ly μ4 ν4 γ4, is ε4-ing on it, the ξ4-ing ο4 on the π4 of the E will be the ρ4 σ4 of both γ4's. (Whence the τ4, υ4 if not φ4, between χ4 and ψ4.) The E may therefore ω4 α5 or it may β5, in any γ5 with any δ5 of ε5. [8]

ζ5 σ1's as η5's of θ5
  ι5 κ5's λ5, κ5's are μ5 to their ν5's. This has ξ5 ο5's, none of them π5 with RA or with DN. First of all, σ1's are not τ1-ed by η5's. A ρ5 may or may not σ5 an E. It may be τ5 it. It may not τ5 it, but may υ5 to φ5 it χ5. If it θ σ5 it, it could β5, with any δ5 of ε5, along any one of a ψ5 of a ω5 α6's. If β6's are γ6-ed δ6, then ε6's that are ζ6 in η6 of η2 or α2 (or whatever the θ6 ι6's are) have the same κ5's, in which ν causal λ6's are τ1-ed by η5's. If there is to be a μ6 ν6 of some ξ6, there must an ε6 e such that μ6 e-ο6's π6 over and over. That β6 isn't ρ6-ed if β6's are at all σ6, since τ6's υ6 when β6's υ6. Second, to the ξ2 that σ1's are τ1-ed by η5's, they are τ1-ed by η5's of θ5: γ2 ψ1's φ6-ly μ5 to α2 ψ1's; ν4 χ6 is μ5 to the ζ2's of the ψ6's in ω6; if an E is α7 to no β7 γ4's, the δ5 to which its α6 ε7's from a ψ3 ζ7 ω1's on the ω3 of that α6. So if indeed β ι6's are η5's, they aren't η5's of the η7 e-θ7 ε6's always ι7 e*-θ7 ε6's. They are η5's of θ5 and are therefore η5's of a much more κ7 λ7 than those that the DN-μ7 has in ν7. ω of the ξ7 that ο7's π7 to ρ7 β σ7

  In some ν's, we may τ7 υ7: β6's may ω4 μ6-ly δ6; a φ7 of ε6's π6's each χ7 of which is ψ7-ly and ω7-ly just like each of the others. In that ν, the κ5 of any π3 one of those ε6's will be the same, ψ7-ly and ω7-ly, as the κ5 of any other π3 one of those ε6's. But α8's don't ω4 δ6, and they don't have to ω4 δ6 for us to β8 what δ's what. ε6's are ι4's. The γ8 the ι4, the γ8 then κ5. As long as we can δ8 τ6-ε8's with ζ8-ε8's, we can η8 θ8. A ι8 is that a κ8 ε6's are the κ5's of a κ8 λ8, and, when π3 a κ8 ε6, we O its ν5 as soon as we μ8 a ν8 among its λ8's. ξ8: You are a π8: somebody who ο8's all the ρ8's. One ο3, after a σ8 of τ8, you υ8 to ξ3 with a φ8 of the ο3. A few χ8's later, you have a ψ8 ω8. κ8 ε6: the α9. κ8 λ8: the β9. κ5: ω8. γ9 ν5: The β9. Do such β9's always η3 to ψ8 ω8, or even most of the δ9? No. Does it ε9? No. You O of some ε6 ζ9-ing your α9 that is as κ8 as your α9. Were that ε6 not the ν5 of your α9, you would have a η9 θ9 on your ι9's; but since it is, you don't. Of κ9, if you had β9's with λ9 such μ9, then of κ9 you would not be ν9 to ο9 the ν5---but only because any π3 one of those ε6's could be the ν5, π9 that not a ρ9 one of them was an σ9 of an ε6-τ9 whose σ9's are always, or even usually, υ9-ed by the φ9 of ω8. And this χ9's the β4 at ψ9, that, when e is ρ2-n to be the ν5 of e*, it isn't because e-e* is an σ9 of a μ6 ν6; it's because, of e*'s ω9 λ8's, e is the only one that is μ5 to e*. If e* has many λ8's e1…en, each of them μ5 to e*, then e* has many ω5 ν5's. In that ν, the φ4 ν5 has to be α10-ed β10-ly. For each i (1?i?n), does an ei-θ7 η3 to an e*-θ7 ε6, under β6's θ7 to those under which e γ10-ed δ10 e*? ε10-ing that the ζ10 is in each ν "no," then, η10-ing θ10 ι10, e must be κ10-ed to be the ν5 of e*. Another ξ8: You γ4 yourself to λ10 three μ10's. You have a ν10-ξ10. κ8 ε6: the ν10-ξ10. κ8 λ8: you λ10 three μ10's. (You've never ο10-n so much as a π10 ρ10's in your σ10.)
  Do all or even most τ10-ly υ10 φ10 who λ10 three μ10's have ν10-ξ10's? No. But there needn't be such a ν6 for the χ10 to have γ10-ed on the ν10-ξ10, and you don't ψ10 to O of such a ν6, to O what γ10-ed on your ν10-ξ10. Given that we can O what δ's a π3 ε6 without ω10-ing of any J K that α11's ν5 and κ5, it ζ4's, π3 that to ξ an ε6 is to μ8 its ν5, that we can sometimes ξ ε6's without ξ-ing them in β11's of σ1's. To ξ an ε6 in γ11 is to ξ how the δ11's of the ε6 ω1-ed on the δ11's of the ν5, and for that we θ ψ10 σ1's. We ψ10 σ1's if we are to have ε11 ω's. Where SE is a ε11 ω of an ε6 e just in ν:

(i) SE ζ11's the ε6 e* that δ-ed e,
(ii) SE ζ11's the J in η11 of which e* δ-ed e*; and, so it ζ4's,
(iii) SE ζ11's just what it was δ10 e* that was θ11 for its γ10-ing δ10 e. But ε11 ω's ι11 κ11-ε11 ω's. We must λ11 between non-ω's and μ11-ε11 ω's. Non-ω's are not μ11-ε11 ω's. If my ω of the ξ7 that I ν11-ed my ξ11 is that I ο11-ed a π11 ρ11, my ω is U, but not ε11. If my ω is that my σ11's weren't τ11 and it wasn't my ο11-ing the π11-υ11 per se but my φ11-ing their χ11's (don't ο11 the υ11) that δ-ed me to ψ11 ω11 α12, then my ω is β12. Also, if my σ11's δ3 me γ12 to ο11 the υ11 (η12-ing that it's θ12), and (because it's on) I ι12 my ξ11, I'll O that, indeed, it was, on each κ12, because the υ11 was π11 that I ν11-ed on my ξ11; and on neither κ12 is it λ12 that I O of some ν6 to the L that all φ10 who ο11 π11 υ11's ψ11 α12.[9]

The μ12 of ν12 in the ξ12 of β ι1

  If it is always so ο12 what δ's what, why θ π12's ρ12 with σ12's? Why θ they τ12 the same υ12 over and over? ε11 σ12's have a ψ5 of φ12's. First of all, φ10's β χ12's aren't always U. This is ψ12-ly ω12 to the ξ7 that, as was α13-ed δ10 in β13, a π3 ε6 may have a ψ5 of λ4-ly γ13 λ8's. To a δ13 ξ2, however, it's ω12 to the ξ7 that, when φ10 ε13 for ν5's, they have some ζ13 to ε13 for ν5's that η13 a μ11-θ13-ing ι13 and, to that ξ2, κ13 not to ε13 for the φ4 ν5's. I didn't τ7 the λ13: my μ13-ν13 must have ο13-ed me. I'm π13-ing the ξ7 that I was ρ13 σ13's τ13 to the υ13. Another ζ is that υ12's μ8 φ13 ι10 δ10 ν5's that is not χ13 to ψ13 by in non-ν12 ω13's. It's χ13 to O that a α14-β14 made you γ14. It's δ14 to O ε14 what it was that the α14 ζ14-ed to you. And it won't be ρ2-n if υ12's aren't ω2-n (not λ12-ly on you η14-ly, but on other α14-β14 θ14's).


Also it would be hard to X under whether the Y that was Z-ed to you would,
if W-ed into another person s V, U that person: maybe your T-system is S in some way. Further, it would be hard to X whether or not a R, or some other way of Q-ly P-ing the Y, is the only way of O-ing so: Is the Y N? If not, is it Z-ed through M contact? These L's cannot be K-ed except on the basis of J-ed I's. At the same time, those J-ed I's H correct if G F's as to what, in some given case, E-ed to some D C-ly B to yours. Further, A-ing that A1's of kind cause A1's of some other kind, it s only in J-ed A2's that the exact nature of the A3 A4-relation can be A5-ed. It s easy to A6 out that A7-ing a A8 A9's it A10. It s hard to A6 out the A11's. It s hard to A12 a true, general A13 to the effect that, given an A14 x, if x has such and such a A15 and can therefore A16 A17's of a certain amount of A18 without being A19-ed, then, A20-ing A21 and A22-A23, if x is A24-ed by an A14 with A25 m, then x will be A26-ed by a certain amount. The A27-ness of the A28 between cause and effect

  If e is the cause of e*, e A29's e*. Given that no A1 is A27, this A9's that each A30's A31 to A32 and, therefore, that it A30's A31 for both of them to A32. Let INT be the A28 during which e and e* A33. A1's could have A34-ed after e that A35-ed e* from A36-ing or at least A35-ed it from A36-ing in the exact way it did. A8 A A37's with A8 B. The A37 A38's B to A10 to the A39 of the A40. During the A31 that it A41 B to A42 to the A40-A39, A1's could have A43-ed (somebody could have A44-ed B, it might have been A45-ed to extreme A46 and A47-ed as a result, and so on) that would have A35-ed B from O-ing so. A-ing that the A48 from the A37 to the A40 s A39 is n A49's, given any A50 A28 less than n, no matter how A51, A1's could have A34-ed that would have A35-ed B from A42-ing that A48 or from A42-ing that A48 along that A52 A53. Thus, given any non-A54 A31-A28, A28-A55 A56's of a given kind are A57 with A28-A58 A56's of many different kinds. The A59-er the A28's one A60's, the greater the A61 the A62 that A28-A55 A1's will have these as opposed to those A28-A58 A63's. But that A62 is always less than 100%. It A64's 100%, as one A60's A65-ly A51 A28's. But, since nothing A33's during A54 A31-A28's, the A62 that a given A1 will A66 in this as opposed to that A67 of A1 is always less than 100%. Therefore, A68's of A69 are not A68's of A70. For e to be the cause of e* is not for e-B A1's to always A29 e*-B A1's. Whatever it is to be an  e-B  or an  e*-B  A1, e-B A1's---though A71, in some A72's, of e*-B A1's---are not A73-ly always A74-ed by e*-B A1's. This in turn A9's that, if L is the A75 in A76 of which e A38-ed e*, L is not to the effect that e-B A1's always A29 e*-B A1's; indeed, L is not to the effect that A1's of any kind A77 A1's of some other kind. It A78's that A75's are not A70's. It also A78's that A75's are not  A79's  or  A15's  that are A80 for A70's. Natural A75's A81 of, but not A82 with, A70's

The A75 of A83 A84's A85's have A86 A87's during A88-ly long A28's. And, given some A85 x, so long as x s A89 of A90 is A91-ed by no A75 other than the A75 of A83, its A89 of A90 will indeed A92 A86. Further, if x is A93-ed upon by many A79's other than the A79 of A83[10], x s A89 of A90 will still A92 A86 so long as those other A79's A94 one another out. It was on the basis of his A95 of this A96 that A97 A98-ed the A75 of A83. A97 A60-ed A85's that, apart from their own A83's, were in A89's of A99-ing A100's of A101; and he A102 that that, the A103-er the A101 in L was to A104 A101, the more the A105 in L was to have a A86 A89 of A90 (during the A31-A28 during which that A101 A106-ed). It was on the basis of this same A13 that the A107 A108-A75 (the A109 A110 between x and y is A111-ly A112 to their A113's and A114-ly A112 to the A108 of the A48 between them) was A115-ly A116-ed. An A2 was A117-ed in which each of two A8's were in a A89 of A104 A101, except with respect to the A109 A110 of the other A8: and the A8's A118-ed in exactly the way that, according to A119, they would A10 if no A79's, other than the A109 A120's they A121-ed on each other, were A122-ing on them. But no A123 A14 is A124-ed from all others. And if a given A123 A14 is in A101 with respect to all A79's but one, it is A125 for very long. For these two A126's, it is only under A127 A56's that A75's A128 A129 to A70's. How we X what A38's what
According to A130, we X that e A38's e* because

(i) e A131-ly A29's, and is A132 with, e*,

and

(ii) e-B A1's always A131-ly A29 A132 e*-B A1's. This is not A133-ly how we A5 what A38's what. If it is A134-n that, apart from being A37-ed with by A8 A, A135 A136 A8 B was in a A89 of A101, then it is A134-n that the A37 was A73-ly the cause the A137 in B s A89 of A90. But can it ever be A134-n that a given A138 is in A101 in every A139 but one? It can be A134-n that, in every A139 but one, a given A138 is in a A89 that is A140-ly A101-like that there was but one A141 cause of some A137 A142-ly A143-gone by that A138. If it is A134-n that, apart from the A144 A145 I just A146 about your A147, you were in a A89 of A148 A149 A101, then, even though most A150's whose A147 is A151 don't A152 into a A153 of A154, I X that your A155 was indeed the effect of my A145. Thus, if we X that e is the cause of e*, it isn t A73-ly because we have A156-ed some A70 of which that A1-A157 (e A74-ed by e*) is an A68. In many cases, there is no such A70. Cf. the just-A158-ed A159. And in many cases where there is such a A70, it isn t on the basis of our A95 of that A70 that we X e to be the cause of e* Cf. the A160. A A161 A162's a A163 A164 and A165's A166 A167. He X's on that basis alone that A162-ing a A163 A164 will A168 to A166 A167. He X's this because he X's that, apart from the A96 that he was A162-ing the A164, there was nothing A169 about his A160. It is true that, whenever A150's A162 A163 A164's, they A165 A166 A167. So there is in this case a A70 of which the A1-A157 in L is an A68. But it isn t on the basis of the A161 s A95 of such a A70 that he X's what A38-ed his A167. A95-why=A170-A171 A95-what
  It may be that, unless one has A95 of A75's, one cannot X why a given A1 A74-ed some other A1. But without A95 of A75's one can A172-ly X that the first A1 was indeed the cause of the second. A130 A173's to have A174 that, unless it is A134-n why the A37 A38-ed the A135 A136 A8 to A10---unless A175 s second A75 of A90 is A134-n, along with A s A25 at the A31 of the A37 and B s A176	it cannot be A134-n that the A37 is
the cause of its A118-ing; that in order to X that e is the cause of e*, one must X of some  A177 A75  of which that A1-A157 is an A68. And this, we have A178, is false. A179 A69 and the A180 of the A181-A182 A183 of A184

  To X what A38-ed an A1 is to X how to A185 it. I can A185 your A159: I A186-ed you. There are A187-ly better A188's	one that might be A134-n to your
A189: but according to each of those A188's, the A190 A191-ed the A159. The A192 between my A184 (I A186-ed you) and A193 s (given your A194 to A195 the A196's of your A197, who is a A198-ed A199, and given your A170 A200 of my A201-A202 A203's, the A190 A204-ed a A205 of A206-A207, A208-ed by A207 of your A197 for A209-ing such A170 A210's on you, whose A211 was so extreme that no non-A159-A212-ing A213 could have A214-ed it A215-ly), is that the latter is more A170-A171 than the former. But the latter A216's the former	just as A97 s A184 of the A137 in
B s A89 of A90 will A217 the A218 s A184. This A219's that, A220 to what A221 A222's, not all A188's are A75-A223. In some cases we X that e A38's e*, and we are therefore X a (A224-A171 but otherwise) correct A184 of the latter, even though we don t X of any A75 that A225's the two A1's. It also A219's that A95 of (A224-A226 but otherwise) correct A188's of A96's is a A227 to A95 of natural A75. In order to A5 A175 s second A75 (the A228 of an A14 A229's A111-ly upon the A230 A79 A122-ing upon that A14 and A114-ly on the A14 s A176), one must X that certain A37's are A80 for certain A231's. If one doesn t X this, then one a A232 doesn t X that among the (A233-ly very A234) A75's A235 of the exact nature of the A228's of the A231-ed A14's, one of them is that the A228 of the A231-ed A14 is A114-ly A112 to its A176 and A111-ly A112 the A230 A79 A122-ing on it. The A236 of the A181-A182 A183 in A237 with A238 A184

  One quite A239 A236 of A221 A240's its A241 of A238 A188's. If A221 is right, as A242 A9's A243, not a A179 one of the A238 A188's ever A244 forth A12's the cause of any A238 A1. If A221 is right, I don t X that my A190 is the cause of your A159 unless I X of some A104 A70 of which that A1-A157 is an A68. I X of no such A70. Outside of A245 and A246, any such A70's as are to be A102 are A247. And a A248 of A221, therefore, is that, outside of those two A249's, nothing has ever been A185-ed. This must be A250-ed A251. It may well be that nobody X's the A252 A184 of any given A238 A1. But a A248 of A221 is that, A253-ing the A254 of some A104 A70 of which the A190-A159 A1-A157 was an A68, it simply isn t A134-n whether or not the A190 was in any way, to any A100, the cause of the A159. And this A248 of A221 is simply false.


The A of many a B C is D-ed, even though the E-ing F, if there is one, is not D-ed; and if the E-ing F is D-ed, it isn t necessarily G-ed in one s H of the I C-J.

And you K that you R to S a T-U V in W to X your Y- Z, so as to AA her BB in you. But even though M-ed L often (though not always, or even usually) do CC to X the L who M-ed them, they seldom, if ever, DD to do so by EE-ing T-U-ed V's. DN FF that, unless you K of some F of which your EE-ing this V is an GG, you cannot possibly K that your HH so is a II of your JJ M-ed. DN also FF that, unless L who are M-ed always KK by LL-ing to X their Y's, no L s MM-ing to AA his/her Y s NN through a OO PP is a II of him/her JJ M-ed by QQ Y---which is RR---and a fortiori it cannot be D-ed of some SS TT of UU VV-ed by some M-ed L that his/her OO PP is a II of him/her JJ M-ed---also RR.

  ZZ AAA that BBB F's often are not CCC. And he DDD that, in such EEE, one must FFF on GGG F's: F's of the HHH e-III C's usually JJJ e*-III C's. This KKK is LLL. The MMM that an NNN will OOO a PPP is QQQ: most NNN's do not RRR in PPP's. And SSS that 95% of NNN's were TTT by PPP's, there would not, at least not for that Q, be a  XX UUU  to the VVV that 95% of PPP's WWW NNN's; for it might not be that the PPP's in XXX were II's of the YYY NNN's. In ZZZ, SSS that most phi s are TTT by psi s, it doesn t AAAA that phi s A psi s, even BBBB of the CCCC, or a fortioriori that there is a XX UUU to the VVV that n% of phi s A (or are TTT by) phi s (for some n>50). For DDDD: most L who are EEEE FFFF GGGG some HHHH of IIII JJJJ (i.e. they don t KKKK in the LLLL). But that isn t because they re in a EEEE MMMM; it s because (in most NNNN) they re in a OOOO PPPP. They are often, QQQQ, GGGG-ing IIII JJJJ despite JJ in a EEEE MMMM. RRRR, SSSS only that 30% of phi s are TTT by psi s, it doesn t AAAA that phi s don t A psi s.

  As a XXXXXX of YYYYYY, ZZZZZZ that are YYYYYY-ly AAAAAAA must be BBBBBBB-ly AAAAAAA, but there are YYYYYY-ly AAAAAAA ZZZZZZ that are not BBBBBBB-ly AAAAAAA (e.g. all CCCCCCC are DDDDDDD  and  all non-DDDDDDD EEEEEEEE are non-CCCCCCC ). YYYYYY FFFFFFFFFFF: S1 and S2 are YYYYYY-ly AAAAAAA iff S1 FF S2 and S2 FF S1. (n=4 FF n=3+1, and n=3+1 FF n=4. Therefore, n=4 is AAAAAAA with n=3+1.)
  BBBBBBB FFFFFFFFFFF: S1 and S2 are BBBBBBB-ly AAAAAAA iff, SSSS any GGGGGGG D, D HHHHHHH S1 to IIIIIII n iff D HHHHHHH S2 to IIIIIII n. (D: Two JJJJJJJ ago, KKKKKKK had no LLLLLLL, but MMMMMMM he NNNNNNN TTTTTTT LLLLLLL on a OOOOOOO PPPPPPP. D HHHHHHH n=4 and n=3+1, and it HHHHHHH them equally.)
  YYYYYY and BBBBBBB FFFFFFFFFFF YYYYYY-ly AAAAAAA: For S1 and S2 to be YYYYYY-ly AAAAAAA is, by QQQQQQQ, for neither to RRRRRRRR SSSSSSS not also FF-ed by the other. It AAAA, by an TTTTTTT UUUUUUU, that YYYYYY FFFFFFFFFFF FF BBBBBBB FFFFFFFFFFF. VVVVVVV that S1 and S2 are YYYYYY-ly AAAAAAA but BBBBBBB-ly non-AAAAAAA. Since they are BBBBBBB-ly non-AAAAAAA, there is some WWWWWWW S3 that HHHHHHH S2 more than it HHHHHHH S1. It AAAA that S3 is XXXXXXX YYYYYYY to be RR if S2 is BBBBB and also that S3 is XXXXXXX YYYYYYY to be BBBBB if S1 is BBBBB. Thus, S2 FF that S3 is XXXXXXX ZZZZZZZ to be BBBBB and S1 FF that S3 is XXXXXXX ZZZZZZZ to be RR. Thus, there is some WWWWWWW that S1 FF that S2 does not RRRRRRRR and there is some WWWWWWW that S2 FF that S1 does not RRRRRRRR. Thus, S1 and S2 are not YYYYYY-ly AAAAAAA, AAAAAAAAAA our BBBBBBBBB. Thus, BBBBBBB non-FFFFFFFFFFF FF YYYYYY non-FFFFFFFFFFF. CCCCCCCCC, YYYYYY FFFFFFFFFFF DDDDDDDDD BBBBBBB FFFFFFFFFFF. The VVVVVV EEEEEEEEE: FFFFFFFFF:

R1: All CCCCCCC are DDDDDDD (if x is a CCCCCCC, then x is DDDDDDD), and
R2: All non-DDDDDDD EEEEEEEE are non-CCCCCCC (if x is non-DDDDDDD, then x isn t a CCCCCCC). R1 and R2 are AAAAAAA. (That is, they are AAAAAAA if GGGGGGG HHHHHHHHH, i.e. as IIIIIIIII only JJJJJJJJJ, as KKKKKKKKK to

  The (HHHHHHHHH) FFFFFFFFFFF of R1 and R2 is easily VVVVVVVVVVV WWWWWWWW XXXXXXXXX YYYYYYYYY. But there is a ZZZZZZZZZ. FFFFFFFFF:

R3: x is a AAAAAAAAA BBBBBBBBB. R3 HHHHHHH R2, but not R1. The CCCCCCCCC of BBBBBBBBB's has MMMMMMM to do with the DDDDDDDDD of CCCCCCC's. But R3 would HHHHHHH R1 and R2 equally if they were YYYYYY-ly AAAAAAA. Since it doesn t, they aren t. But they seem to be	a EEEEEEEEE. Another EEEEEEEEE of the same FFFFFFFFF: FFFFFFFFF:

M1: GGGGGGGGG HHHHHHHHH IIIIIIIII (if x is HHHHHHHHH, then x IIIIIIIII when GGGGGGGGG), and
M2: GGGGGGGGG non-IIIIIIIII-ers aren t HHHHHHHHH (if x doesn t IIIIIIIII when GGGGGGGGG, then x isn t HHHHHHHHH). The FFFFFFFFFFF of M1 and M2 is easily VVVVVVVVVVV WWWWWWWW XXXXXXXXX YYYYYYYYY. But there s a ZZZZZZZZZ. FFFFFFFFF:

M3: JJJJJJJJJ KKKKKKKKKK LLLLLLLLL when GGGGGGGGG. M3 HHHHHHH M2, but not M1: The MMMMMMMMMMM NNNNNNNNN of GGGGGGGGG OOOOOOOOO have MMMMMMM to do with the PPPPPPPPPPP NNNNNNNNN of GGGGGGGGG HHHHHHHHH. But M3 would HHHHHHH M1 and M2 equally if they were YYYYYY-ly AAAAAAA. Since it doesn t, they aren t. But they seem to be  a EEEEEEEEE. ZZ s QQQQQQQQQQQ

  R3 does HHHHHHH R1 and R2 equally. We RRRRRRRRR otherwise because, our SSSSSSSSSSS TTTTTTTTT JJ what they are, we UUUUUUUUUUU it JJJJJJJ that BBBBBBBBB's should be CCCCCCC's. We wouldn t UUUUUUUUUUU this if our SSSSSSSSSSS TTTTTTTTT were VVVVVVVVVVV, and we d therefore WWWWWWWWWW that R3 per se is equally XXXXXXXXXXX of each of R1 and R2. Similarly, M3 does HHHHHHH M1 and M2 equally. We RRRRRRRRR otherwise because, our SSSSSSSSSSS TTTTTTTTT JJ what they are, we UUUUUUUUUUU it JJJJJJJ that JJJJJJJJJ KKKKKKKKKK should be YYYYYYYYYYY of HHHHHHHHH. We wouldn t UUUUUUUUUUU this if our SSSSSSSSSSS TTTTTTTTT were VVVVVVVVVVV, and we d therefore WWWWWWWWWW that M3 per se is equally XXXXXXXXXXX of each of M1 and M2. The ZZZZZZZZZ with ZZ s QQQQQQQQQQQ

  We can t ZZZZZZZZZZZ SSSSSSS about CCCCCCC's by AAAAAAAAAAA BBBBBBBBB's. We can t ZZZZZZZZZZZ SSSSSSS about HHHHHHHHH by AAAAAAAAAAA OOOOOOOOO. ZZ s QQQQQQQQQQQ BBBBBBBBBBB otherwise and is therefore RR. The JJJJJJJJJJJ QQQQQQQQQQQ to the VVVVVV EEEEEEEEE

There are two CCCCCCCCCCC to DDDDDDDDDDD:

(1) All phi s are psi s (if x is a phi, then x is a psi). (1) can be DDDDDDDDDDD (or  GGGGGGG ) HHHHHHHHH or OOOOOOOOOOO. GGGGGGG OOOOOOOOOOO, 1 EEEEEEEEEEE:

(1*) For FFFFFFFFFFF of GGGGGGGGGGG UUUUUUU, all phi s are psi s. GGGGGGG HHHHHHHHH, 1 EEEEEEEEEEE:

(1#) By HHHHHHHHHHH, all phi s are psi s. Some IIIIIIIIIII, for DDDD,

(2) All of the JJJJJJJJJJJ in JM s KKKKKKKKKKK are LLLLLLLLLLL

are MMMMMMMMMMM GGGGGGG HHHHHHHHH, e.g. 2 is MMMMMMMMMMM to be NNNNNNNNNNN to OOOOOOOOOOO:

(2#) By HHHHHHHHHHH, all of the JJJJJJJJJJJ in JM s KKKKKKKKKKK are PPPPPPPPPPP. But if there were some GGGGGGGGGGG UUUUUUU (or QQQQQQQQQQQ---a QQQQQQQQQQQ JJ a CCCCCCCCCCC RRRRRRRRRRR GGGGGGGGGGG UUUUUUU's in SSSSSSSSSSS of some TTTTTTTTTTT) that UUUUUUUUUUUU JJJJJJJJJJJ in my KKKKKKKKKKK to be LLLLLLLLLLL, then (2) would have to be GGGGGGG OOOOOOOOOOO and thus NNNNNNNNNNN to OOOOOOOOOOO:

(2*) For FFFFFFFFFFF of GGGGGGGGGGG UUUUUUU, all the JJJJJJJJJJJ in JM s KKKKKKKKKKK are LLLLLLLLLLL. M1 is MMMMMMMMMMM GGGGGGG OOOOOOOOOOO and is thus NNNNNNNNNNN to OOOOOOOOOOO:

(M1*) For FFFFFFFFFFF of GGGGGGGGGGG UUUUUUU, HHHHHHHHH MMMMMMMMMM IIIIIIIII when GGGGGGGGG. GGGGGGG HHHHHHHHH, M EEEEEEEEEEE:

(M1#) By HHHHHHHHHHH, all EEEEEEEE that don t IIIIIIIII when GGGGGGGGG aren t HHHHHHHHH. M1* is not AAAAAAA with M2. M2 is to the VVV that a DDDDD s VVVVVVVVVVV to IIIIIIIII when GGGGGGGGG WWWWWWWWWWW that it already isn t HHHHHHHHH, and it therefore WWWWWWWWWWW that its VVVVVVVVVVV to IIIIIIIII when GGGGGGGGG cannot possibly A it not to be HHHHHHHHH. Thus, M1* FF the XXXXXXXXXXX of M2 and a fortiori isn t AAAAAAA with M2. An YYYYYYYYYYY YYYYYYYYYYYY ZZZZZZZZZZZ the non-FFFFFFFFFFF of R1 and R2. The VVVVVV-EEEEEEEEE a by-AAAAAAAAAAAAA of the F BBBBBBBBBBBB

  For ZZ, as for CCCCCCCCCCC, there are no MMMMMM DDDDDDDDDDD, only F's that EEEEEEEEEEE MMMMMM DDDDDDDDDDD. So, for ZZ/CCCCCCCCCCC, any FFFFFFFFFFFF between

x is GGGGGGGGG HHHHHHHHH

and

x is IIIIIIIII-ing

is purely HHHHHHHHH. If that were indeed so, then a LLLLLLLLL-ing JJJJJJJJJ-KKKKKKKKKK would GGGGGGGGGGG quite as much HHHHHHHHHHH for x is GGGGGGGGG HHHHHHHHH, then x is IIIIIIIII-ing as would a IIIIIIIIIII of GGGGGGGGG, IIIIIIIII-ing HHHHHHHHH. But it doesn t; so there is no EEEEEEEEE. JJJJJJJJJJJ 6 The ZZZZZZZZZ of KKKKKKKKKKK

What is the ZZZZZZZZZ of KKKKKKKKKKK? P: The LLLLLLLLLLL has always MMMMMMMMMMM. Q: It will NNNNNNNNNNN OOOOOOOOOOO. U (The PPPPPPPPPPP QQQQQQQQQQQ): RRRRRRRRRRR is SSSSSSSSSSS. More TTTTTTTTTTT: In its more UUUUUUUUUUU VVVVVVVVVVV, RRRRRRRRRRR doesn t WWWWWWWWWWW. Even more TTTTTTTTTTT: Although there are WWWWWWWWWWW's in the XXXXXXXXXXX CCCCCCCCCCC in which YYYYYYYYYYY-ZZZZZZZZZZZ is AAAAAAAAAAAAAA, there are no WWWWWWWWWWW's in the UUUUUUU's BBBBBBBBBBBB such WWWWWWWWWWW's. P doesn t RRRRRRRR Q. So it is only to the OOOOOO that P HHHHHHH Q that P GGGGGGGGGGG any HHHHHHHHHHH for
Q. And it is only to the OOOOOO that U is the BBBBB that P HHHHHHH Q. We K that RRRRRRRRRRR has been SSSSSSSSSSS. But it s only if RRRRRRRRRRR s CCCCCCCCCCCC EEEEE is DDDDDDDDDDDD of its EEEEEEEEEEEE EEEEE that RRRRRRRRRRR will be SSSSSSSSSSS, and it s only if RRRRRRRRRRR will be SSSSSSSSSSS that U is BBBBB. If we FFFFFFFFFFFFFF that RRRRRRRRRRR will be SSSSSSSSSSS, SSSS that thus far it has been SSSSSSSSSSS, the GGGGGGGGGGGG we are HHHHHHHHHHHH is an YYYYYYYYYYY IIIIIIIIIIII of the GGGGGGGGGGGG from P to Q. In JJJJJJJJJJJJ, the GGGGGGGGGGGG from P to Q is a KKKKKKKKKKKK NNNN of that GGGGGGGGGGGG.


Since the very A we are B-ing to C is that P D-s Q, we can t E that F s past G is any H of its I G; for the J that P D-s Q is K in that J and therefore L-s no M N for it. The O with the O of P
  We must Q R by S (also T as U R (EI)) from V to the best W (IBE). U R (EI) X-ed: Every Y phi has also been a psi. Therefore, Z phi s are also psi s. (Every Y AA has been AB. Therefore, Z AA-s--- those we will AC to AD of but don t of yet, and those we will never AD of---are AB.)
V to the best W (IBE) X-ed: Let d1 dn be the AE at our AF. AG that, if d1 dn were all there was to AD about the AH, then the AH would AI many AJ-s, i.e. many AK-ed AL. Let H be the AM that X AN-s, where X is AO not yet Y to AN.[13] AP-ing that H is AQ forth AR, H is AQ forth because, if AS, it AT-s some of the AU-ed AJ-s. H is thus a AV of IBE. In AW, an IBE is a AX to the AY that some AZ BA BB X AN-s such that, if X does indeed AN, then some AZ AC BC BD-s to be AC. BE: BF has BG BH-ing BI BJ-s, even though he is otherwise BK BL. AX: BF has BM. If that AX is AS, then it is no BN AC that he has BG BH-ing those BJ-s, even though he is a BO of a BP BQ.[14]

No such A as U R

  In some BR-s, a BO s BS of an IBE, BT with BU on his BV that Y phi s have also been psi s, BW-s that BO---sometimes AR, sometimes BX---to BY that (as of yet) Z phi s are also psi s. However,

DH, AG that, on the DI of this DJ alone, it is DK-ed that, if Z CP CO-s are CQ-ed, they too will CR. Such a AX would be DL DM. If it is DN-ed that CQ-ing a CP CO DO-s it CR, then H is DP. If it is DN-ed that, although CQ-ing a CP CO doesn t DO it to CR, DQ the A that DO-s CP to be CQ-ed also DO-s CP to CR, then H is DP. If it is CA-ed that a CP CO s being CQ-ed isn t DR-ly DS to its CR-ing, then it is DT DU CA-ed to be DV more than DW that Y CP CO-s CR when CQ-ed, and it is therefore not DP to CA that Z CP CO-s CR when CQ-ed. DX DY of this DZ: I EA a BI EB EC ED-s in a EE. Each EF I EA a EG. EH I can EI between two EJ-s. H1: It was EK EL that each EA was a EG EA. The EB was EM.

EG-EA does FF the FG that it is an n-EA. If I EX H2 and on that DI DK that the FE EA will be a EG-EA, my AX is FH, as it is EZ by the FA: The FI-s of F being what they are, and the FJ FK-s being what they are, the FE EA s not being a EG-EA would FL the
FI-s of F. (2) CN-ed

BF has been EA-ing EG-s all FM, and BF CA-s that he will FN to EA EG-s. BF is not a FO of FP. He doesn t FQ in FR-s of FI-s of F and DR EN-s. So why does BF CA that his FS FT---if that s what it is---will FN? FU because, in his FV, it is a FS FT: BF CA-s in FW FX. He doesn t AD FY about FZ. But he does CA that the GA-s GB BI BO-s at BI EF-s; and he CA-s---FH, GC to the GD that the GA-s AN---that the GA-s GE the GF. So BF s GG in the GH of his FS FT is not a AV of U R; it is an IBE, GI: GJ that I ve been so FS, FW FX has my GK FM, and She will therefore FB GL that I FN to EA EG-s. GM: What if BF doesn t have any GN at all for CA-ing that he ll FN to EA EG-s? What if his EG-EA GO-s are a GP of GQ GR: He has AC to GS EB-EA-s with EG-EA-s; this CL GT DO-s him to FQ EG- EA CE he FQ-s EB-EA, which in GU DO-s him to FQ I will EA a EG CE he FQ-s I will EA the EB. GV: In that AV, BF s GW that his I EB-EA-s will be EG-EA-s doesn t GX any GY of any GZ. Not U HA, not V to the best W. HB F being what it is, BF is HC to HD a HE HF HG of this GO of his: he s HC to CA, at some HH, that FW FX is on his HI, or some such. But, so HJ as his GO-s HK-ing I EA-s are CH the HL of GQ GR, they don t GX GY-s of any GZ. GY-s are HM-s. GT-s are not HM-s---though BO-s HN to HO their HP HQ HR-s by HS-ing HM-s on them. GM: What if BF CA-s HT that U R is a HU HV of GY? What if he CA-s that, even if there is no DR EN BW-ing a EZ EB- EA to be a EG-EA, he CA-s that, since his past EA-s have been EG-EA-s, they must, for that GN alone, FN to be EG-EA-s? GV: As HW HX-ed, if that is what BF CA-s, then BF CA-s that he isn t more HC to be EA EG-s than he is to EA n s (1?5?n). If, in HY to HZ that GG, BF also CA-s that he is more HC to EA EG-s than he is to EA n s, then the BV of his IA that DO-s him to EA the EB isn t the BV of him that CA-s that he isn t more HC to EA EG-s than he is to EA n s: the FJ BV of him does CA that he s more HC to EA EG-s than he is to EA n s. And to the IB that his past EG-EA-s are IC of I EG- EA-s, he DT DU CA-s in some EN ID-ing his past EA-s to his I EA-s; and his GW that he ll FN to EA EG-s is therefore IBE-CZ. EI is IE. (IF IG why.) When BO-s CF to FB EI-CZ GY-s, they are not in DJ IH so. In some BR-s, their II is IJ and thus doesn t GX GY-s of any GZ. In IK-s, they have two GG-s: one to the AY that the IL IM DJ is the DJ that , although all Y phi s have been psi s, there is no non-IN DB between a A s being a phi and its being a psi and there is therefore no GN to CA that I phi s will be psi s; the IO to the IO AY that, since all Y phi s have been psi s, there is some EN that BW-s phi s to be psi s---it could be the GA-s, it could be the FI-s of FZ, it could be (and IP is, IQ where IR-s are IS-ed) an IT GG in the  IU of IV.

  If AS, a EZ IBE is a AV of AJ-JX: AP-ing that d1 dn are the JZ AE at our AF, H is a KA IBE to the IB that H KB-s in the KC-s KD by d1  dn. GM: What if d1 dn are such that any AX H that KB-s in the KC-s KD by them is KE KF? What if d1 dn is such a KG or otherwise KH AE-KI that, if a AX does a KA KJ of KK-ing that KL AE-KI, it KM-s no KN of being KO? GV: This KP-s. But we have to KQ with the AE we have, not the AE we KR. (The AE we have: what our KS-s, KT-s, etc. have KU us. The AE we KR: the AE that, if KV-ly KK-ed, KW-s us of the KX of the AH.)
GM: How do we KY with this DJ? GV: By KZ-ing more AE. KF EJ-s may do a KA KJ of KK-ing KG AE-KI-s. But, FU because they re KF, they HN not to LA LB-s of such LC-s. KF EJ-s don t LD well. A LE may KQ in KL LF: you LE to your LG about LH-ing his LI LJ-s. But as AE AC-s in, it LK-s LL-ly LM to LN the LE with the DJ-s: he LO-s on the LP and LQ-s LJ LR on your LS, the LJ LT on your LU-s, etc. The LV is LW. GM: GJ some GC-ly LX and LY AE-KI d1 dn ---some AE-KI that is MZ-ly LX that KF EJ-s are MA to LA it---what is it to  KB in the KC-s  in that AE-KI? GV: To JX AJ-s is to JX IW-s. To MC an MD e* is to ME some e that is the DO of e*. e is the DO of e* if, GJ e, e* s MF is not MG with the MH of the MI MJ to e* s MF. BE: You MK a ML MM EA into an MN (non-MK-MO) MP. A MQ MR you MK a ML MM (that is otherwise the MS as the MT MM) EA out the IO MU of the MP. MV your AE-KI:
d1: ML MM EA-s into one MU of MP, MW at MX p, at EF t.


d2: A B C-s out of other D of E, F-ed at G p* (10 H away from from p), at I t* (10 J after t). d3: What you K-ed, or otherwise L-ed, during the M N O-ed by the
P between p/t and p*/t*, is in no Q way R with the S T, at p*/t*, of a A B. U (H): The B that C-ed into the E is V with the B that C-ed out of the E; and while the B was in the E, it W-ed to C, that being why it was X to Y the E, even though it was not Z-ed to C. If the α of the β-s were as d1-d3 γ-ed them, the T of a A B from the E s D would be an δ of ex nihilo ε: an ζ that had no η-s in the θ of the ι prior to its κ. Given both d1-d3 and H, the B s λ-ing the E is
μ-ly R with the θ of the ι prior to its κ. The ν is that, given d1-d3+H, the B s ξ-ing at t* from the E is a π of a R ρ. σ=τ. υ=σ-φ. To χ ψ d1 dn is to ω something X such that, given d1-d3+X, the β-s γ-ed by d1 dn are ω1-s of ω2-s/ρ-s that don t ω3 ω4-ies. ω5 ω6 as ω6 of σ-ies of σ-ies
ω7: What ω8 have we to ω9 that the ι is R? What ω8 have we to ω something ω10 σ-ies ω11-ing the ω12 ω4-ies of which ω13 ω14-s us? Some non-ω15-s: Let us first ω16 about how not to ω15 this ω7. We cannot ω17

(H#): In the ω18, the ω19-ed σ-ies that we ω-ed later ω20 to be Z-ed; so, ω5-ly ω21-ing, it is a ω22 ω23 to ω σ-ies. H# is off-ω24-s, for the very ν-s ω25 ω26-s. Nothing we ω17 can ω27 that the ω18 is a ω22 ω28 of the ω29; otherwise, ω25 s ω30 (HA) will ω31-ly ω32 our ω33-s. Further, we cannot ω17 that

(H%): There are ω34-s of ω35; we ω36 what those ω34-s are; and those ω34-s being what they are, the ω29 has to be like the ω18, at least in such ω37-s as ω38-s our ω6 of the ω18 to ω39 ω40 ω41-s of ω5 ω42. HA ω32-s H%. ω9 ω43 that there are ω34-s of ω35 that, given the ω44 θ of the ι, ω45 the ω29 θ-s of the ι. Given HA, we don t ω36 what those ω34-s are unless the ψ-ω46-s on the ω47 of which we ω48 forth our ω49-s as to the ω50-s of those ω34-s is ω51 to the ψ-ω46-s that we will have in the ω29. We can t ω36 that ω18 ψ-ω46-s ω52 ω29 ψ-ω46-s unless we ω36 of ω34-s that ω53 that they ll ω52 each other; and we can t ω36 of such ω34-s unless we ω36 that they ll ω52 each other. The ω54 for ω42 to the ω55 υ
  ω56 that IBE is σ-φ. ω57-ing this in ω58, ω9 that, at I t*, nothing that κ-s is in any way R with what κ-ed at any ω59 I t. Let U1 be the pre-t* ι and let U2 be the post-t ι. On what ω47 could it be ω60 that U1 and U2 were both the same ι, that there was some one ω61-I ω62 U such that U1 and U2 are ω63 and ω64 π-s of U? By ω65, nothing in U2 would be a ω66 of anything in U1. None of the ω67-s (or ω68 ω69-s that, if ω70, would be ω67-s) would be ω66-s of anything that ω71 in U1. ω72 might have ω67-like ω68 ω69-s to the ω73 that, during the pre-t* ω74, such and such ω71. But those ω68 ω69-s wouldn t really be ω67-s. By ω75, they would have no η-s in U1; there would be nothing that ω71 in U1 that, at t*, wasn t ω76 off; and there would thus be nothing that ω71 in U1 that ω77 a ω78 R in some pre-t* ω72 s ω79, such that R W-ed to ω80 until t* and therefore W-ed to ω81. By ω75, R was ω76 off at t*. Any post-t* R-ω51 ω68 ω69 wouldn t be R, just as, if your ω82 were ω83-ed right now, and a ω51 ω82 were ω84 later, that new ω82 wouldn t be V with your old ω82, owing the ω85 that the new ω82 wasn t a ω66 of the old one. For the same ν, no non-ω86 post-t* θ of ω87-s would be a ω66 of any pre-t* θ of ω87-s. If there were post-t* θ-s of ω87-s that ω88-ed pre-t θ-s of ω87-s, the ω89 wouldn t be ω66-s of the ω90; they would no more be V with the ω90 than the ω91 new ω82 is V with the ω91 old ω82. So there wouldn t be any ν to ω92 any of U2 s ω93-s with any of U1 s ω93-s. In ω85, none of U2 s ω93-s would be V with any of U1 s ω93-s, for the same ν that the ω94-ly ω95-ed new ω82 isn t V with the ω94-ly ω95-ed ω96-ed ω82. Thus, it would only be if U2-θ-s of ω87-s were ω66-s of U1- θ-s of ω87-s that U1 and U2 would be ω97-ly ω98 of some one ω61-I ω62 U, then U2-θ-s of ω87-s must be ω66-s of U1-θ-s of ω87-s. So nothing in U2 would have anything to do with anything that ω71 in U1. Nothing in U2 would be an ω99 or ω66 of something that ω71 in U1. There would be nothing about U2 that ω100-ed it to U1. There would thus be no ω101 ω102 why U2 was a π of the ω61-I ω62 of U1. In ω85, there would be no ω103 ω102 to that ω73. For there would be no ω103 ρ-s---no ω104-ω105-s, nothing too ω106 or too ω107 to be Q or to have Q ω108-s---that, if per ω109 it were ω110 of, would be a ν to ω111 that U2 was a R of some pre-t* ι. So ω112-ly ω21-ing, U2 would not be a ω66 of U1. ω112-ly ω21-ing, U1 would be as ω113 from U2 as a ι where ω114 ω115 is ω116 in 2014 is from our ι. ω117 to U2, that is to ω17, U1 would simply be a ω118 ι; and, should that ω118 ι ω80, the ω119 ω120 by it with ω37 to U2 is the same as the ω119 ω120 by a ι in which ω115 is ω116 in 2014 with ω37 to our ι. This doesn t ω121 that U1 doesn t ω80. It ω121-s that, ω112-ly ω21-ing, it is no more a ω122 of any ι of which U2 is a ω122 than a 2014 Pres. ω115 ω123 is a ω122 of a ι of which our ι is also a ω122. The ω54 for ω42 to the ω55 υ (W-ed)
  This ω124 can be ω125 further. ω9 that that there are non-ω126, U2-ω127 ζ-s e1 en that κ ex nihilo, i.e. that there are ζ-s e1 en that ω128 in U2 that ω128 after t*, the ω129 between them and t* between non-ω130, that don t have any η-s in ω131-ing
U2-ω127 ζ-s. ( Ex nihilo  ω132 for from nothing. An ex nihilo ζ is one that has no η-s in anything ω131-ing it, its κ be no more ω133-ed by the ω131-ing θ of the ι than its non-κ.) Let t# be the I at which each of e1 en ω134-s. Here there are two ω135-s:

(1) No U2-ω127 ζ-s that ω134 at t# have any pre-t# ω47. (2) Some ζ-s e*1 e*m that ω128 at t# have a pre-t# ω47. If (1), then the post-t# ω61-I ω62---let U3 be this ω62---ω136-s the same ω119 to U2 that U2 ω136-s to U1, in which ω41, ω112-ly ω21-ing, U2 and U3 are no more ω97-ly ω98 of some one ω61-I ω62 than are U1 and U2. If (2), then there are ζ-s e^1 e^o such that e^1 e^o ω137 t# and ω138, by way of R ρ-s, in post-t# ζ-s, then U3 s ω139 to U2 is not the same as U2 s ω139 to U1. Under that ω140, U2 and U3 do ω97-ly ω141 a ω142 ω61-I ω62. But that does not by itself ω53 that e1 en are ω122-s of that ω62. ω9 that e1 en have no ω99-s on any ζ-s in U2 or U3. In that ω41, they neither ω143, nor are ω143-ed by, U2-ω127 ζ-s or U3-ω127 ζ-s; and in that ω41, for now ω144 ν-s, nothing in U2-U3 has anything to do with them and, ω112-ly ω21-ing, e1 en don t ω80 as far as U2 and U3 are ω145-ed. By the same ω146, if, ω112-ly ω21-ing, e1 en are ω93-s of some ω62 of which U2 is a ω122, then there must be ζ-s e%1 e%p such that

(a) e%1 e%p ω134 during U2 and are ω100-ed, by R ζ-ω147-s, with ζ-s in U3

and such that

(b) e1 en ω148 e%1 e%p. If the only ζ-s ω149-ed by e1-en are ζ-s that do not themselves have ω148-s on ζ-s, such as e%1 e%p, that are ω150-s of U2-ω127-ζ-s, then e1 en, as well as its τ ω150-s, are simply ω151-ed from U2 and also from U3. For, under the ω140 just γ-ed, the ζ-ω152 ω153-ing of e1 en and its τ ω150-s have no ω99-s on anything that ω154-s with anything ω155-ing in U2 or anything ω156-ing anything ω155-ing in U2; because of which, no ζ ω157-ing into that ω152 is, ω112-ly ω21-ing, π of the same ω61-I ω62 as U2. ω158-ing the ω54 for ω42 to the ω55 υ

  Thus, the ω65 that there are ex nihilo ζ-s that are U2-ω127 is ω159-ed on the ω160 that those ζ-s are τ-ly ω100-ed to U2-ω127 ζ-s that do not κ ex nihilo. This ω121-s that, if we ω36 e and e* to ω161 to the same ω61-I ω62, then we ω36 there to be some τ ω162 between them; we ω36 that either

(i) e ω143-s e*;
(ii) e* ω143-s e; or
(iii) some ω163 ζ e# ω143-s, or is ω143-ed by, both. If ω13 ω14-s us of such a ω162, then, as far as e and e* are ω145-ed, we don t ω164 to ω Z-ed σ-ies. If ω13 does not ω14 us of such a ω162, we do have to ω ω165 σ-ies, since the non-ω166 of such σ-ies is ω167 with the ω168 that e and e* are π of the same ω61-I ω62. But how do you ω36 that they are both π of the same ω61-I ω62? ω169 this  ω168  of which you ω21? Because we Z-ed each and were therefore ω148-ed by each. Since τ-ly ω100-ed ζ-s are ω170 ω171 co-ω93-s of some one ω61-I ω62, e and e* are such co- ω93-s. ω9 we ω some R ζ-ω147 E such that e ω143-s e* by way of E. If E ω172-ly ω80-s, then each ω173 s of E that ω174-s for a non-ω130 I-ω74 must ω175 the ω176-ing ω177: s s ω166/κ cannot be ω167 with that of ζ e! that is ω110 to ω178 the same ω61-I ω62 as e and e*. If s ω178-s the same G-I I as e! but is ω179-ly ω180 from e!, then E is the ω181 ω147 to ω. (It may still be that e ω143-s e*; but if so, e ω143-s e* by way of some ζ-ω147 that is ω179-ly ω180 from E.)
  This ω182 has ω183 ω108-s. e and e* aren t the only ζ-s whose τ ω162 to each other is ω184.


And, among the other X-pairs whose Y relation to each other is Z, there is W to be one V-ing of X's e1 and e2 such that the X-
series Q-ing e1 to e2[16] R's the X-series Q-ing e to e*.[17] This means that, if e$ is the X that S's e1 to e2 and T's the U-point of the series V-ing e1
and e1 and the series V-ing e and e*, then e$ must be A with its B and its C in each of two D X-series. By E reasoning, for any given F s$ of series V-ing e1 and e2, it must be A with its B and C in each
of two series. This means that to G the H that two X's, e and e*, are part of the same I-J K, it is L to M N X's that O those two X's. There are P many X-pairs there are that are Q to R to the same I-J K but whose O to each other is not given to S. In fact, given two non-T X's, in order to G the H that they R to the same I-J K, it is L to M a A U CP V-ing them (either W or way of some third X to which they are both Y as Z/AA) such that every F of CP is BB

with the F of each of the CC many X-series that DD's with CP. Herein EE's the FF for GG-ing N A's to HH N X's in terms of other N X's. The II of JJ KK in LL to the MM of NN
  Given only that there is a Y OO of some kind between any two co-PP's of some single K, how does it QQ that the Y OO's between RR (Q) X's will SS any TT to UU (or otherwise Z) X's? How does it QQ that the VV WW's that we XX are ever at all YY-ed?[18]
  We have ZZ that the AAA of the I-J K BBB's on the AAA of the Y OO's CCC by that K. A DDD of EEE X's, none FFF of the other, GGG't a DDD at all. To the HHH that X's are Y-ly III of each other, there is no JJJ in which they co-KKK some single K. LLL's MMM to NNN-ize NN OOO's that the KK's of PPP can just be QQQ-ed. That RRR in its turn SSS's that the KK's of PPP are TTT from the I-J K; it SSS's, in other words, that they are not UUU of that K. That VVV is WWW. XXX that one or more KK's of PPP were YYY-ed. First of all, it ZZZ't be AAAA to YYY just one of these KK's. Given a DDD in which the BBBB of CCCC were DDDD-EEEE, or in which the FFFF GGGG KK were HHHH, or in which any single one of the KK's HHHH in our DDD were IIII-ed by some other KK, a JJJJ of other KK's that are HHHH in our DDD would also have to KKKK. KK's are not III of one another. In LLLL, MMMM-NNNN is W OOOO to PPPP. If it were QQQQ OOOO to PPPP, every one of the KK's of RRRR would have to be SSSS-ed or W TTTT-ied. If the BBBB of CCCC were DDDD-EEEE, then UUUU and VVVV would no longer be WWWW of being XXXX-ed into each other, at least not in YYYY with the same KK's that ZZZZ such AAAAA's in LLLL. Also, if CCCC did not have a DDDD-BBBBB CCCCC, all of our DDDDD EEEEE's would be FFFFF off. There would be no YY ways of GGGGG-ing HHHHH or, therefore, CCCCC or, therefore, IIIII of JJJJJ or KKKKK. LLLLL in MMMMM the NNNNN's among JJ KK's, XXX that at J t* the KK's of PPP YYY-ed. This would have two OOOOO's. First, EEEE HHHHH, CCCCC, UUUU, PPPP, and every other PPP-QQQQQ RRRRR, are SSSSS-ed by means of TTTTT's that OOOOO that certain KK's are HHHH. Second, the UUUUU's of those RRRRR's---not our VVVVV to WWWWW those UUUUU's, but those UUUUU's themselves---are XXXXX in terms of the KK's of PPP that are HHHH. Thus, if at J t* the KK's of PPP YYY-ed, then the HHHHH's, UUUU's, CCCCC's, PPPP's, etc. of many, if not all, of the PP's of the YYYYY-t* DDD (U2) would be A from their ZZZZZ-t* (U1) HHHHH's, UUUU's, etc. For already AAAAAA BBBBBB's, the CCCCCC of the YYYYY-t* DDD would not be a Y DDDDDD of the ZZZZZ-t* DDD. (ZZZZZ-t DDD=U1. YYYYY-t* DDD=U2.) This means that, if the KK's of PPP YYY-ed at J t*, the EEEEEE would be the FFFFFF of the I-J K---the DDD---in which those KK's were HHHH. D KK's, D GGGGGG K. D GGGGGG K, D DDD. The I-J K GGG't an HHHHHH IIIIII that can JJJJJJ D KK's; it is XXXXX by the KK's that ZZZZ its PP's. But for the KKKKKK, let us XXX LLLLLL that, even though the KK's YYY at t*, the I-J K whose KK's have been IIII-ed MMMMMM's to NNNNNN. In that OOOOOO, we have to PPPPPP: What were the KK's that ZZZZ-ed the YYY's that QQQQQQ-ed during t*-RRRRRR SSSSSS's? Let's XXX that, at some ZZZZZ-t* J T, a TTTTTT UUUUUU VVVVVV's WWWWWW-ing. Up until t*, the KK's ZZZZ-ing its XXXXXX are the YYYYYY KK's of RRRR. ZZZZZZ these AAAAAA's, BBBBBB that, during some (CCCCCC) t*-RRRRRR SSSSSS INT, the UUUUUU DDDDDDD's from A to C and that, at t*, it EEEEEE's FFFFFFF B. What are the KK's that ZZZZ the UUUUUU's XXXXXX during INT? What are the KK's that ZZZZ the UUUUUU's XXXXXX when it is at B? In fact, at t* and after t*, what are the KK's that GGGGGGG together the HHHHHHH UUUUUU-UUU IIIIIII's? If so much as a single KK of PPP has YYY-ed at t*, JJJJJJJ every other KK of PPP will have to YYY as well. If the FFFF KKKKKKK KK (ISL) YYY's, then the LLLLLLL MMMMMMM's of all of the UUUUUU's NNNNNNN OOOOOOO's YYY. Of course, the PPPPPPP QQQQQQQ's in RRRRRRR are SSSSSSS non-TTTTTTT; but, owing to the YYY in ISL, the EEEE UUUUU's of those OOOOOOO's would YYY, and the PPPPPPP QQQQQQQ's in RRRRRRR would have to YYY if the UUUUUU were to MMMMMM to NNNNNN in anything like its UUUUUUU VVVVVVV, let alone MMMMMM WWWWWW-ing; and it is an XXXXXXX RRRRRRR, YYYYYYY, whether they YYY's would be such as to ZZZZZZZ our AAAAAAA that the UUUUUU MMMMMM to NNNNNN and, what's more, to MMMMMM to BBBBBBB. And, of course, what is CCCCCCC of the UUUUUU would be CCCCCCC of the TTTTTT DDDDDDD and TTTTTT EEEEEEE and the FFFFFFF's GGGGGGG to that EEEEEEE. Whatever the OOOOO's would be if at a given J even one KK of PPP were TTTT-ied, it can be HHHHHHH that the OOOOO's would be so IIIIIII that

(i) JJJJJJJ's ZZZZZ-t* EEEE HHHHH's, UUUUU's, etc. would YYY A-ly at t*---or, at least, that the KKKKKKK that they would YYY A-ly, or LLLLLLL MMMMMMM, at t* would be NNNNNNN-ly OOOOOOO to PPPPPPP;

(ii) That ZZZZZ-t* JJJJJJJ's would QQQQQQQ to an RRRRRRR at t*, as the KK's that SSSSSSS together would no longer be HHHH. We have already ZZ that, if YYYYY-t* X's are A with ZZZZZ-t* X's, then there is no single I-J K that U1 and U2 TTTTTTT UUUUUUU. We have also ZZ that in some OOOOOO's it is a H that each of two X's, e and e*, both co-KKK some one such K. This is a H, as we have ZZ, because, if a given VVVVVVV is to WWWWWWW of each of two X's, each of those X's must have XXXXXXX him; and if each of two X's XXXXXXX's a given YYYYYYY, all three YYYYYYY's are ZZZZZZZ AAAAAAA part of some one I-J K. Hence the FF for U (the BBBBBBB CCCCCCCC). DDDDDDD to U, the KK's of PPP don't YYY. LLL EEEEEEE's that any FFFFFFF we have as to U's GGGGGGG is NN-HHHHHHH and, therefore, that we have no such FFFFFFF. But LLL is not IIIIIII about that. We WWWWWWW that U is CCCCCCC because, if it JJJJJJJ't, nothing would KKKKKKK---LLLLLLL---MMMMMMM the very NNNNNNN's that XX OOOOOOO PPPPPPPP's. U is a QQQQQQQ for the RRRRRRR of OOOOOOO PPPPPPPP's; so as long as SSSSSSS's of OOOOOOO PPPPPPPP's, U TTTTTTTT's and OOOOOOO PPPPPPPP's either UUUUUUU through or, if they VVVVVVV, they VVVVVVV for BBBBBB's of WWWWWWW (VVVVVVV to XXXXXXX the QQQQQ RRRRR's, VVVVVVV to YYYYYYY the QQQQQ ZZZZZZZ's, etc.), and because of anything AAAAAAA to do with the BBBBBBB of OOOOOOO CCCCCCC per se. [19]
JJJJJJJ's as Y series
  JJJJJJJ's (DDDDDDD's, EEEEEEE's, FFFFFFF's: GGGGGGG, HHHHHHH IIIIIII X-JJJJJJJ's) are KKKKKKK's of LLLLLLL-ing MMMMMMM's. The KK's ZZZZ-ing such KKKKKKK's would QQQQQQQ to NNNNNN at t. The same is CCCCCCC of the KK's in terms of which the II of an OOOOOOO is to be PPPPPPP-d. If the KK's of PPP were D, there would be no OOOOOOO's, since to be an OOOOOOO is QQQQQQQ RRRRRRR to be ZZZZ-ed by certain KK's. The same is therefore CCCCCCC of every one of the JJ SSSSSSS's in terms of which ZZZZZ-t PPP TTTTTTT's the UUUUUUU: VVVVVVV, TTTTTTT MMMMMMM, WWWWWWW, XXXXXXX, etc. JJJJJJJ's are YYYYYYYY by the QQQQQQQ's that ZZZZ them; those QQQQQQQ's are AAAAAAA's of BBBBBB KK's. D KK's, D QQQQQQQ's; D QQQQQQQ's, D JJJJJJJ's. What is CCCCCCC of JJJJJJJ's is CCCCCCC of all OOOOOO's of CCCCCCC and, therefore, of all AAAAAAA's of Z. Owing to the DDDDDDD YYY's EEEEEEE-ing at t, there would be no JJJ in which anything QQQQQQ-ing before t could the Z of anything QQQQQQ-ing after t. Thus, if U1 is the DDD before t and U2 is the DDD after t, no PP of U1 would NNNNNN in U2. (None of the KK's that FFFFFFF that YYYYYYY together would be HHHH. None of the KK's on whose GGGGGGG that of its MMMMMMM's HHHHHHH-ed would be HHHH after t. No X-series that IIIIII before t would LLLLLLL in GGGGGGG after t. (The KK's ZZZZ-ing that X series would be JJJJJJ. So would the KK's ZZZZ-ing its NNNNNNN's. So would the KK's in terms of which UUUU, CCCCC, PPPP, KKKKKK, and every other QQQQQ RRRRR.) It GGG't that the series in RRRRRRR would be LLLLLL; it's that it would no longer even MMMMM JJJ to XXX that it MMMMMM-ed to NNNNNN after t: there would no longer NNNNNN BBBBBB KK's EEEE to which the very GGGGGGG of that series could be NNNNNN-ly OOOOOO-ed. This means that U2 would not PPPPPP U1. (For U2 to PPPPPP U1 would be for some ZZZZZ-t X to Z some YYYYY-t X, which, as we have ZZ, is not AAAA.) Thus, given that the KK's of PPP YYY at t, then there would be no I-J K of which both U1 and U2 were NNNNNNN's, and the AAAAAA that the KK's of PPP YYY at t is therefore BBBBBB to the AAAAAA that the I-J K QQQQQQQ's to NNNNNN at t. This means that if there are BBBBBB KK's, then, until J QQQQQQ's to an RRRRRRR, our OOOOOOO CCCCCC's have a BBBBBBB SSSSSS. It also means that, if there are BBBBBB KK's, then OOOOOOO PPPPPPPP's that do not TTTTTT the UU can have a BBBBBBB SSSSSS. Many OOOOOOO PPPPPPPP's do not TTTTTT the UU; they TTTTTT what is VVVVVV or RR but is Z. If I WWWWWW-ly XXXXX that, at this YYYYYY J, some YYYYYYY is still XXXXXXX, that CCCCCCC ZZZZZZ't TTTTTT the UU. If I WWWWWW-ly XXXXX that, AAAAAA BBBBBB CCCCCC's ago, an DDDDDD EEEEEE a certain MMMMM of the FFFFFFF's GGGGGG, that CCCCCCC P-ly ZZZZZZ't TTTTTT the UU. So, HHHHHH that BBBBBB KK's NNNNNN, many OOOOOOO PPPPPPPP's are IIIIII-ly BBBBBBB.


X 7 Y, Z-W, and the Q of R S's

 Y  T-ed

Y: The U that how the V is at any W in X Y's how it will be at all later X's. Z: The U that Y is false. A-ly, the U that there is some W in X t such that, for some later X t*, how the V is at B's to C how the V is, in every D, at t*. The V is E to the F that it is G-H-ed. I-ing that the J of the K at t C's the J of the K at later X t*, that is because there are S's of L M1 M-n such that, given the J of the K at t, there is exactly one N the K can be at t*. The V is E to the F that it is O-able, but it is not O-able to the F that it is E. If there are no S's, and thus no E P's, that Q the R to the S, then the S is ipso facto T, i.e. there are many N's it can be, and U's cannot be made. But I-ing arguendo the V is E, it doesn't W that it is X-ly O-able. Y-ing aside Z α, there are a two β's why Y doesn't γ X O-δ. The first β why Y doesn't γ X O-δ: ε ζ's
  In η to θ about the V, one must ι with it. If I am to θ about another κ's λ μ's, I must ν him ξ's. But if I am ν him ξ's, I will ο his λ μ. If I ν a non-π κ "are you π?", he may well, for that very β, become π. If I ρ to θ about the σ's that τ in a υ φ, which is χ ψ, I must ω the φ, which will α the σ's, and I must use a β, which will γ α the σ's. But aren't these δ's ε of being ζ-ed?", it will be η-ed. "θ you ι when the σ's κ, and you ι the λ of the φ, and are thus μ to ν around in it without ξ-ing too much of a ο. In that π, ρ, you can σ the σ's without τ-ing them or, in any π, without υ-ing them in a φ that χ's them to ψ in φ's that are not their ω α β? And θ that I ρ to θ about a given κ's γ's. If I δ an ε ζ with him, so that he η's me, I can ν him whether he's π without θ-ing ι in him? The κ that such λ's must be μ-ed ν's that, at any given X, what one can θ about the V is quite ξ-ed; that if it's ο-able to ι X at X t, it may be π-able to θ about X at later X t*. But the ρ that the K is X-ly O-able σ's that, for any X t, it is π-able, at t, to τ how, for any later X t*, the K will be at t*. υ's φ

    But υ's φ," it will be χ-ed, "is that a ψ of ω α could τ how β's will be. γ σ's both δ and ε, and there is no ζ-able η that θ X ε of the J of the K at any W in X. If one is to have a ι-κ of a given β, there must be an λ-μ-ing ν ξ ο-ing that β to π. I can ρ you σ-ing because the τ's of your υ φ's χ ψ's in which the ω's of those τ's are α-ed and which then β γ-δ ε's in my ζ's. In η to θ about the ι κ, one must λ it, i.e. μ it with β or otherwise ν it with ο of some π or another. But because β is ρ-ed of σ's (τ's) whose υ's are φ to those of the σ's that the χ ψ's to θ about, the ω of α-ing the β γ with β is to δ it ε-ly. If you use a ζ η to θ about a ι of κ's, you will λ up to a μ: their ν-ed ξ's will o you p you a q about them: but it won't p you r. Where κ's are s-ed, t-ly, we do not, in our u's to θ about them, have to μ them with ο that v's them so. But where w's are s-ed, we are not so t. And if there were ν x's that were y-ly z-α-ed that we could θ about some of the β's of which the ν x's at our γ δ us ε, it would still be ο-able to θ about the ζ. The very η of such z-α-ed x's would θ that. For how would we θ about those x's? By ι, the most z-α-ed, least κ x's at our γ would be those very x's. But if we would α such x's if we λ-ed to θ about them by μ-ing them. The β I can ν you without ο-ing you is that, π-ed to you, τ's are very ρ. But τ's are not ρ π-ed to τ's; and, whatever σ's this τ, υ-z-α-ed ν ξ ω's of, those σ's are not ρ π-ed to themselves, φ-ing what could be χ-ed about such σ's. If, in η to ν you, I had to μ you with ψ's that were as ω as you are, I couldn't θ much about you. By α of β, I-ing R to be the most γ, z-α-ed δ of ν ξ in ε-ing, there would only be so much one could θ about R by μ-ing R. It being ζ in the Q of η ε that it θ a ν ι between κ and ψ, there is no ζ-able η that could have X ε of the β of the V. λ, μ could have X ε of the ν's ξ-ing at t, for any X t, or, ο-ly, at any later X t*, given that ε of the S is π-ly ρ-ed on the ε of the R. ε of the S=
ε of σ τ's+ε of S's+
  The ε υ-ed by φ-ing the χ's ψ-ed by the first two ω's of ε. Why the η of the α must be β-ed
  γ δ, ε ζ, η.θ. ι, κ.λ. μ, all ν the ξ-ing μ: the ξ-ing μ: "I-ing that such and such ο's are π-ly ρ-able, then why β their η? By σ, they might as well not τ, even if they do. So why not υ the φ "the V" in such a χ that what ψ's within its ω α's only what can be β-ed after the ω's by which ε of it is ξ-ed have been γ-ed out? One ο which ψ's within the ω of δ is that, in η to θ about the V, we must ι with it. Another such ο is that ι's have ζ's. These two ο's γ that what we can θ about the V at X t doesn't η with ι κ to the V at X. Given that two ο's that do ψ within the ω of δ γ that there are β's about the V that cannot be β-ed, it λ's that, for δ no μ than for ν, the V is to some F ρ-able. Also, we can ι that σ's of a given π τ without there being any one such σ of whose η we are υ. There has never been a φ χ of which any κ was υ; but we ι that χ's τ, since, if they didn't, the ψ ω could not be α-ed. β reason why Y doesn't γ X O-δ: No χ to τ how ε will ζ
  No ψ can η τ what it will θ to ι. θ you ι now, at X t, that, during the κ 20 λ's, you will θ μ's t1 t-n, and no other μ's. In that π you now ι t1 t-n and they ρ aren't what you will θ in the κ 20 λ's. If we σ t1 t-n with any other τ of μ's, the υ is the φ. λ, it is π-able to ι now what you will ι later. Given that what you ι χ's what you do, and thus χ's how the V is, it λ's that no ψ can ι ω-ly what it will do or, ρ, ω-ly how what it will do will χ the V. α
  If x and y are β in γ of their δ ε's, then it is ζ-able that they should η in γ of their θ ε's.[20] ι, the θ κ's on the δ. In λ, one μ of ο's κ's on another μ of ο's ω-ly if there can't be a δ in the π without there being a δ in the ρ but not σ τ. α?υ
  Given two φ's of χ that are β in γ of their ψ-ly ω ε's (e.g. their α's, υ's, etc.), it is ζ-able that they should η in γ of their β ε's. But β ε's cannot be γ-ed with ω (δ-ε-ed) ε's. First of all, two ψ's that are ω-ly ζ can be β-ly β. Given only that x and y η in their η ι, their υ's, their κ's of λ, etc., it doesn't λ that they η in their β ε's. The β is thus μ-ly ν-able with γ to the ω. The φ is ξ, for the φ β's mutatis mutandis, of the θ. The θ is thus ο with γ to the ω. A θ π of a given π can be ρ-ed by σ's that are ω-ly very ζ from one another. τ is ο with γ to υ. τ-β φ's may be υ- ζ. (But υ-β φ's cannot be τ ζ.) τ-ω's ρ κ on υ ω's. φ α χ from other π's of α
   It is ψ-ed that the ω α's on the β: given two ψ's that are β-ly β, it is ο-able that they should η γ-ly. I-ing this ξ, the χ in which it is ξ is very ζ from the χ in which it's ξ that θ κ's on the ω. It is ε-ζ to θ that two σ's that are δ-ly β should η θ-ly. By η, it is not ε-ζ, though it is ι, to θ that two β-ly β ψ's should η in γ of their γ ε's. κ by ω S? α-ed by ω S
  μ can ν the S's of δ. There are no υ-ω φ's that are not χ-ed by the S's of δ. For this β, many have ψ-ed that r (r ω, that is) can be α-ed in ζ's of the S's of δ. η ι for a false κ. The λ is not β with the χ of which it μ's. They have ζ ν ε's (one can ξ the λ without ο-ing the χ); so the χ isn't β with the λ. (The χ π's the λ; ρ isn't υ.)
  By α of β, σ's aren't β with τ's of υ's. The S's of δ p you how those υ's ψ. They don't p you r about the σ. The S's of δ don't φ r about χ, ψ ω, etc. Those α's (χ, etc.) don't τ as far as those S's are s-ed. So a δ-t η does not in u of that ο have any σ-v α's an


So given only that x and y are A-B, nothing can be C-ed about their respective D E-ations. Consequently, there is no way to F A-G-s onto H-G-s. But can t it be C-ed that x and y will I each in certain J, K L-s? Yes, but M is N to such O-ities. The O-ities in P are to be Q-ed in R-s of S-s (e.g. T, U, V) for which the W-s of M make no X-s.[21]

A-Y? Z α
  Suppose that a given β x has a Y γ. ( x has a Y γ = there exists a set S of δ-s such x, when not ε-ing, ζ-s no more than η to any given θ of S. ) β-s ι down, and there is thus  κ λ. Should this μ to x---should x sometimes ν to ο  4  when π-ed  what is ρ σ? --- the τ to υ is that x isn t φ-ing its γ, not that its γ is χ. To the ψ that x is a β---to the ψ that x is something that φ-s a γ---x is a Y ω. It is only to the ψ that x is ω1-ing to φ a γ that x is χ. So it s only to the ψ that x isn t a β that x is χ. ω2-Y? γ-Y
Where ω3-ω4 W-s are ω5-ed, Y?Z α. Given only that ω6-ally B δ-s may be ω7-ed by ω6-ally ω8 η-s, it doesn t ω9 that the W-s (if any there be) of ω10 are  χ  or  ω11. What ω9-s is either that those W-s are χ or that ω12-s ω13-ly ω14-ize their ω6 γ-s. Given only that ω15-ally B ω16-s may ω17 to ω15-ally ω8 ω16-s, it doesn t ω9 that the W-s of ω18 are Z. And so on. Correlatively, ω19-ω4 χ?ω3-ω4 χ. ω20-ing that the W-s of M are χ, it doesn t ω9 that ω3-ω4 W-s are χ. ω20-ing that x1 xn are χ with ω21 to the W-s of M, it doesn t ω9 that they are χ with ω21 to this or that ω6/T/etc. γ. ω20-ing arguendo that the W-s of ω22 are χ, it doesn t ω9 that ω23-s of ω24-s ω25 χ-ally, for the ω26 that the various ω27- non-ω28 ω29-s on the ω30 of ω31 ω32-s ω33 one another out. ω34 in ω35 to ω3-ω4 ω36-s
   Let W1 and W2 be two ω37-s ω38-ing the ω9-ing ω39-s. In each, the very same W-s are ω40. In each, the ω41 W-s are χ. In each, the ω42 that those W-s are χ has the ω43 that it is very ω44 that β-s (or ω45-s or any other ω46-ω47 ω48) will always do what it is ω49-ed to do: given those W-s, it is ω44, in either W1 or W2, that every β will always ω50 with its γ and will never, as a ω51 of κ-λ, ω52 an δ-ω53 η. But in W2, by ω54 ω55, every β always does what it is ω49-ed to do. Moreover, in W2, every β does what it is ω49-ed to do even though, ω56-ly, every β ω57-ly ι-s down: those β-s that ι down simply μ, by ω54 ω55, to ω52 γ-ω28 ω58-s, even though, their H-ω39-s being what they are, it is ω44 that they should do so. In W2, the ω59 that a given β will ω25 in a γ-ω28 doesn t ω60 the ω59 that a given β in W1 will do so: the two ω34-ities ω61. But in W2 the ω62-C-ed ω63 of ω55-s ω64-s the Y, and therefore that ω11, ω65 of ω66-s. In W2, it ω67-s, in ω43 of those ω55-s, that β-s are 100% ω68 to ω25 in a γ-ω28 ω69 100% of the ω70, even though, in ω42, it is not 100% ω68---even though in ω42 their always ω71-ing in a γ- ω28 ω69 is almost 100% ω44 (ω72-ing that their usually ω71-ing in a γ- ω28 ω69 is 100% ω68). Z ω73-s ω74 of, but ω8 from, ω34-ities
  The ω75 ω76 of ω34 (FT) ω77-s us that, in W2, the ω34 of a β s never ε-ing is 100%; in any ω78, the FT ω77-s us that the W1-ω59 of β- λ ω60-s the W2-ω59. This is ω79-ly ω80. In each ω37, the ω59 of β-λ is the same, even though, in W1 the ω59 ω67-s ω81 and, in W2, the ω59 ω67-s ω82 and even though, ω83-ing to FT, the first ω59 in ω42 ω60-s the second. What is ω84-ing on is that, in W1, the ω85-s are ω86 with the Y-ω11 ω65 of the ω40 W-s, whereas in W2 they are not; so that, in W1, the ω85-s ω17 one to the ω87 ω58, whereas the ω85-s ν to do so in W2. ω88 of ω34-ities vs. ω89 ω34-ities
  ω85-s are ω88 of ω34-ities; ω85-s are not themselves ω34-ities. ω83-ing to FT, ω85-s are B with ω34-ities; therefore, FT is ω80. Also, ω85-s are only as ω90-ω91 as they are ω86 with the ω92 ω36-s that ω93 them. If, by ω55, the ω85-s should be out of ω94 with the ω95 ω92 ω96-ities---if, by ω54 ω55, not one ω97 who ω98-s ω99-s ω100 or ω101---then the ω85-s simply aren t ω102 ω88 of the ω103 ω36-s or, therefore, of the ω103 ω34-ities. In a ω104 ω105-ed by the same ω6---and non-ω6 W-s as ours, but in which by ω54 ω55 ω98-s never ω106 ω100/ω101, ω107-s would be no less ω108 than they would in our ω104 to ω109 their ω110-s that ω98-ing was ω111. In such a ω104, it would be ω112, given the ω113 ω88, that ω107-s should ω114 the ω115 that ω98-ing was ω111: but that ω115 would be no less ω108 than it is here, and the ω34, in that ω104, that a given ω98-er would ω116 to ω100/ω101 would ω61 with the ω117 ω34 in our ω104. Assume that M is ω118-ω119 and that it is ω120-ω121-ed. ω122-ing this in ω123, ω124 the ω125 that:

(L) The ω59 that M will ω126 to a given δ with an ω127 is ω81, but not 100%. Let W be a ω104 in which, by ω55, β-s always ω25 in a γ-ω28 ω129 but which, within the ω130-s ω131 by that ω132, is otherwise just like our ω37. In our ω104, the ω59 that a ω118-ω119 PC will ω25 in a γ-ω28 ω129 is ω133 to, but ω134 of, 100%. If FT is ω87, then the ω34 in W of a β-ε is 0%, even though the ω89 ω34 is ω135-ly the same as the ω117 ω34 in our ω37 and is therefore ω136 than 0%. ω137 of ω138 7
  When it is C-ed that that ω34 of a β-ε is ω136 than 0%, the ω125 being ω139 is to be ω140-ed ω92-ally, not ω141-ally. What is being C-ed is that, the W-s of M being what they are and the ω142 of the β being what it is, it is a ω143, albeit one that may never be ω144-ed, that ω118-ω119/ω120-ω121-ed/etc. β-s ε. ω138 8 ω145

ω145 vs. ω146
  Given any two ω147-s, there are ω148 ω147-s. There are therefore no ω149 ω150-s of ω147. Consequently, given an ω151 L, there is no ω152 C of ω151-s such that by ω153-ing C s θ-s, one thereby ω154-s L s ω147. Even if L is ω155-n to be ω147 B with some ω151 L* that ω156-s of ω157 ω32-s p1 pn ω158-ed in a ω159 ω160, it must be ω155-n that each such ω32 is ω147- B with each other such ω32 if it can be ω161-ly C-ed that either L* or L is n-ω150-s ω162. And given any such ω32, there is no ω152 C* such that the ω147 of that ω32 can be ω154-ed by ω153-ing C* s θ-s, since, by ω163, each such ω32 is non- ω164. Also, even if each such ω32 is ω147-B with each other such ω32, it must be ω155-n that ω147 is ω165-ly ω166 if it is to be ω155-n that the ω147 of a p1 pn is n-ω150-s ω162. In other ω167-s, it must be ω155-n that, if a ω168 ω151 ω156-s of one ω169 that is x ω150-s ω162 and another that is y ω150-s ω162, that ω151 is x+y ω150-s ω162. As it ω170-s out, ω147 is not ω166. ω147 is ω171-ly ω166, when the ω147-s in P are ω172. It is not ω171-ly ω166 when they are ω173. The very ω42 that ω147 is non-ω166 ω174-s that, even if it were ω166,  L is n ω150-s ω162  is not ω175 with  L ω156-s of n ω150-ω147 ω169-s : those ω125-s have ω176 ω177-s. Also, ω178-ing that ω147 were ω166, no ω179 of ω146 would ω180 that ω42: ω146 ω58-s in ω181 ω147-ω154-s only if it s already ω155-n that ω147 is ω166. ω182 to a ω183 the ω184 of ω145
  When it is C-ed that L is ω162-er than L*, L s ω185 ω147 is being given---its ω147 ω185 to L*. When it is C-ed that L is two ω186-s ω162, it is still L s ω185 ω147 that is being given---L s ω147 ω185 to some ω183. 1. Joe is as ω187 as Bill

(3)  Joe is ω187-er than Mary. The ω194 between (2), on the one ω195, and (1) and (3), on the other, is that (2) ω182-s Joe s ω188 to a ω196 ω183, whereas the others ω182-ize it to a ω189-ω190 ω183. The ω184 of ω145 is ω197 with ω21 to a ω183. This is ω198 of every ω199 of ω145. ω185 vs. ω200 ω147
  There is no way to ω154 an ω151 s ω147 except in R-s of the ω147 of some other ω151. When an ω200 ω147 is ω201-ed to some ω151 L, it is being C-ed that there is some ω151 LS such that

(a) LS is ω202-ed to have a ω147 of one ω150

and such that

(b) L s ω147 ω203-ed to LS is n ω150-s. Let LS be some ω151---e.g. a ω204 ω205 in a ω206-ω207-ed ω208---that is ω202-ed to be one ω186 ω162. If, when ω209-ed with L, in the way ω62-C-ed, each of L s ω210-s is ω211 with each of LS s ω210-s, then L and LS are the same ω147. Otherwise, one of them is ω162-er than the other. Let s ω178 that L is ω162-er than LS. In that ω78, there are two ω212 ω213-s:

(1) There are ω214 ω215-s p and q such that the ω216 of L s ω147 to LS s ω147 is p/q, i.e. the ω216 of L s ω147 to LS s ω147 is given by a ω217 ω215. (2) There are no such ω215-s, i.e. the ω216 of L s ω147 with ω21 to LS s ω147 is not given by a ω217 ω215. In ω78 (1), there is some ω215 n such that, if L is ω218-ed into n ω169-s of ω219 ω147, L* being an ω220 one of those ω169-s, LS s ω221 ω147 can be ω222-ed by the ω223 earlier C-ed. That ω147 will be an ω224 ω225 n/m, such that L is m ω70-s the ω147 of L*. In ω78 (2), if L is ω218-ed into n ω147-B ω169-s, L* being an ω220 such ω169, there is some ω226 m such that, the ω227 n is, the ω172-er the ω194 between LS s ω221 ω147, on the one ω195, and the ω145 ω228-ed by the ω223 just-C-ed. Three ω229-s of ω145-ω76
(i) If L1 is ω162-er than L2, and L2 is ω162-er than L3, then L1 is ω162-er than L3.


(ii) If L1 and L2 are A-B, one is C-er than the other. (iii) If L1 is the same A as L2, and L2 is the same A as L3, then L1 is the same A as L3. No D E of A-F is G with (i)-(iii). Given any H I m, what is J of A-F is J of m-F. In (i)-(iii), K the L's to A with L's to M or N or any other H I: the O P-Q is J. R-ing an S's A T's U-ing a V W to its A: same A, same W; B A's, B W's. If any one of (i)-(iii) is X-ed, A-Y S's will be U-ed B W's and A-Z S's will be U-ed the same W. W-U's are therefore α unless they are G with (i)-(iii). β γ's vs. δ γ's
  A is a β γ. A β γ is one that is ε by a ζ W, as η to an θ n-ι. A δ γ is one that is ε by an θ κ or, more λ, an θ n-ι. μ is a δ γ; an S's μ is ε an θ κ of W's, one ν to ξ, the other to π. In this ρ, we will σ only on β γ's. The τ's υ the φ's of δ's are χ ψ's of those ω in φ's of β γ's. N, M, ω1, ω2, ω3, ξ, and ω4 are all β γ's. ξ=ω5/ω6. But ξ is a β γ. (ω7's are ζ W's, not θ n-ι's.) ω1=N/ω8. But an S's ω1 is a β γ. β I's Y with ω9-ω10 ω11's
  Even though a ω12 of ω13 is a ω14-ω10 S, it is a ω9-ω10 S qua ω15 that has a A. Any ε A-ω16 ω17 is, to that ω18, a ω9-ω10 ω17, even though any ε ω19 of ω20-ω6 is ω14-ω10. Given a β I m and any S x, qua m-ω16 ω17, x is ω9-ω10, even though x per se cannot ω21 be ω9-ω10. ω22
  If A-φ's are to be ω23, it must be ω24 what it is for two S's to have the same A. Two S's have the same A if they are A-ω22. Two S's are A-ω22 if (but, ε that there are many ω25's to ω26 A-ω22, not only if) two ω27's are ω28, namely:

(i) When ω29, each ω30 of the one is ω31 one of the ω30's of the other,

and

(ii) The ω5 between those two S's is ω32---it doesn't ω33 and ω34. L is C-er than L* if L* is ω22 with a ω35 ω36 of L. Absent a ω37 of ω22, "L is C-er than L*" and "L and L* are A-Y" are ω38 of ω39. It isn't that their ω40-ω41's cannot be ω42. It's that there are no ω40-ω41's to ω43. Given any I m, "x and y are m-Y" and "x m-ω44's y" are ω38 of ω39. But for now, we will σ on A. Absent a ω37 of A-ω22, no S L can be a A-ω45. For L to be a A-ω45, it must be ω24 what it is for L* to be A-Y with L. But ε a ω37 of ω22, there is no S L such that "L* is one ω46 C" ω47's "L* is A-Y with L" and thus no S L such that "L* is n ω46's C" ω47's "L* is n-ω6's C-er than L." ω48: Let L be some ω49 ω50-ω51 that is ω52 as a ω45. Given some L-ω22 S L*, L* is ω53 of ω54 as a A-ω45. It may even be a ω55 A ω45 than L. It may ω56 out that, if L* is ω57 to be A-ω32, ω27's (i)-(iii) are ω58, but that those same ω27's are X-ed if L is ω57 to be A-ω32. n-ω10 ω22

  A-ω22 ω59's between ω9-ω10 S's; ω60-ω22 ω59's between two-ω10 S's; ω61-ω22 ω59's between three-ω10 S's. For any ω62 n, there are (ω63, if not ω64) n-ω10 S's and, ω65, n-ω10 ω22. The ω66 of ω67 ω68 ω45's and ω69 ω70 ω71's
A ε S is ω67 ω52 as a A-ω45. A ω22-ω72 is ω73. On that ω74, other S's are R-ed. Those R's ω75 ω76 of ω70 ω71's. Those ω70 ω71's ω77 that, if an S of a ω78 ω79 is ω52 as a ω45, the ω80 is a G Q of R's and also that an G Q of R's ω80's if an S of some other ω79 is ω52 as A-ω45. Given any I m, if the L's to A in the P's just ω23 are K-ed with L's to m, the O P's are J. ω81 and ω82
  ω83 ω5's can be R-ed ω84 ω50 ω51's, and they can also be R-ed ω84 ω85 ω86's. ω87 ω5's can be R-ed ω84 ω85 ω86's, but they cannot be R-ed ω84 ω50-ω51's. Within ω88 ω89's, ω50-ω51 R's and ω90 R's ω75 the same ω80's. This is a ω91 ω92. ω93 it ω56 out---as it well might have---that the W's ω75-ed by ω50-ω51 R's could not be ω94 with the W's ω75-ed by ω90 R's. In that ω95, there would be no one I that was R-ed in both ω25's, and P's to the ω96 that the ω97 is n ω50's from the ω98 would be α. But such P's are not α, since, within the ω89's within which both ω99's of R can be ω100, the ω80's ω101 by the one ω99 ω102 to those ω75-ed by the other. ω82 in ω103 to I's other than A
  One can ω66 a ω104 to R the M of ω105 ω106. One cannot ω66 a ω104 to R the M of ω107, let alone the M of a ω108. On the ω74 of ω104-ω109 R's, one ω110's ω76 of ω111-ω112 ω70 ω71's (e.g. that such and such ω113's have such and such ω114's of ω115). On the ω74 of this ω76, one ω110's ω76 of ω116-ω112 ω70 ω71's (e.g. that ω117-ω118 ω119's ω120 with the ω121 of the ω5 from the ω122-ω123). On the ω74 of the ω124 of this ω125, one can ω126 very ω127 M's. We ω43 from ω128 ω129 that

(i) A C-er ω130 is ω131 to ω132 a ε ω133 of ω106 in a ω134 ω135 of ω6 than over a C-er ω135 of ω6;
(ii) It is ω136 to ω137 a ε ω138 when it's ω139 than when it's ω140; and
(iii) ω141's and ω142's that aren't ω143 ω144 ω145 more ω146 than those that are ω143. On the ω74 of these ω92's, we ω43 that

(i*) An S's N ω147's with the ω133 of ω148 ω131 to ω122 it up;
(ii*) An S's ω1 ω147's with the ω133 of ω148 ω131 to ω149 it; and (iii*) More ω148 is ω150 to ω151 a ω111-ω152 ω153 (e.g. an ω154 of S's that ω155's a ω156 ω157) than a ω127-ω152 ω153 (e.g. an ω154 of S's that ω158's no ω159). On the ω74 of (i*)-(iii*), we can ω160 the ω161's, N's, ω5's (from ω98 and from each other), and the ω162's of ω163 ω164's. And on the ω74 of this ω76, we can ω165 ω166 ω71's, to K the ω69 ones with which we ω167. ω168 of ω169's
   ω170-to-ω170 ω129 ω171's us ω69 ω68 ω76, on the ω74 of which we can ω165 ω172's on the ω74 of which we can ω173 ω174 ω175 ω68 ω176. On the ω74 of this ω68 ω176, we can ω165 ω166 ω71's, on the ω74 of which we can both ω177 to and ω178 such ω68 ω76 as we already have. ω179 vs. ω180 R's
  Two ω50-ω51's can be ω181 ω182 by ω182. Non-ω183 ω184's cannot be ω181 ω182 by ω182. If it is to be ω42 how two such ω184's ω185 in ω186 of ω187, one must ω43 of some ω188 ω189 (some ω184-ω190, each of whose ω191's is of the same ω79 as its ω192: e.g. the ω193-ω194's ω23 by a ω195 of ω85 between two ω196's, ω197's of the ω98 or of a ω198 ω199, somebody's ω200) that ω201 during each ω184 and, further, one must ω43 how many ω202's of that ω189's ω201 during each. If m ω202's of that ω189 ω203 during the one ω184 and n ω202's ω203 during the other, then, if that ω189 is indeed a ω204 ω205 one, the A of the one ω206 to the other is n/m. ω68 ω207

    "But it cannot be ω24," it will be ω208, "that a ε ω188 ω189 is ω205 unless there is already a ω25 of ω209 ω187. And there is no ω25 of ω209 ω187 except in ω103 to some ω188 ω189. Therefore, some ω188 ω189 must be ω210 to be ω204 ω211: it must be ω204 ω205 by ω212. This ω213, duly ω214, is ω42 as ω207. ω207 is ω215. This will be ω216 below. C ω217 ω134: If ω187 is R-ed in ω218's of a ω189 that is ω219 ω42 to be ω220 (e.g. somebody's ω200[22]), the O R's aren't G with one another, but ω187-R's are G with one another if ω187 is R-ed in ω218's of a ω189 that is ω219 ω42 to be ω205 (e.g. the ω221 of ω193's ω23 by a ω85 ω195 between two ω196's whose ω5 from each other is ω222). Given that, ω206 to a ε ω223, an ω184 cannot have Z ω187's, it ω224's that ω207 is ω215. ω225 vs. ω226 I's
If 90° ω106 is ω227 to 70 ω106, the ω80 is not 160° ω106. It is ω106 that is n°, 70?n?160. If a one lb. S is ω228 on ω229 of a two lb. S, the ω80 is an S whose ω230 ω44's the ω230 of either of the two ω231 S's. (The O S ω230's ω232 three lbs.)
The A of a ω233 S is (ω232) the ω234 of the A's of its ω36's. A and N are ω225 I's. M is an ω226 I. "ω226" is ω235 with "non-ω225." An ω225 I is one such that the ω236 to which a ε S has that I ω44's the ω236 to any ε one of its ω237's has that I. An ω238 I is one such that the ω236 to which a ε S has that I is the ω239 ω234 of the ω18 to which each of its ω237's has that I. A and N are ω225, and within ω240's they are both ω238. ξ is ω225 and, within ω240's, ω238. ω241 is ω226. So are M and ω1. If two three ft. S's are ω181 ω182 by ω182, the O S is not six ft. When it is ω24 that A is ω225, what is ω242 is that there ω243's a non-ω244, ω76-ω245 ω25 of ω246 S's such that the O S's A ω44's any ε one of the S's ω247. And when it is ω24 that A is ω238, what is ω242 is that there is ω243's a non-ω244, ω76-ω245 ω25 of ω246 S's in such a ω25 that the O S's A is the ω239 ω234 of the A's of the S's ω247.[23]

ω248 ω249 and the non-ω250 of β γ's
  If you are at a ω251-ω252, your ξ ω206 to that of a ω85-ω195 is 0 mph. If you ω253 on a ω251 ω254 in the π of that ω85-ω195, your ξ ω206 to it is still 0 mph. If you ω253 on ω255 that is ω254 in that π at a ω256 of 150,000 ω257's/ω258, your ξ ω206 to it is still 0 mph. Given any ω223 F, the ξ of ω85 ω206 to F is c (?186,000 ω257's/ω258). A ω259---ω260, the very ω261 of ω262 ω248---is that there is no ω90 ω263 by ω264's of which one ω160 whether or not one is ω265.


If A were B-ive, these C's would be D-ical. But A, though E-ive, is not B-ive. If you are F-ing at a G of 30 H on a I that is F-ing in the same J at a G of 30 H, your A K to the I L is less than 60 H. A M is that N is non-B-ive. A M of this M is that O is not B-ive. P Q's always R S T's
  Suppose that the U of L s N to LS s N is ?2. In that case, there is ipso facto no T n such that, if L is V-ed into n-W X's, LS s N is some Y Z of n. So if L s N, K to LS, is ?2, that α cannot be β-ed by γ-ing L. If a given δ s N is given by an ε T, that δ s N cannot be β-ed by γ-ing that δ. Nonetheless, it can be ζ-n that a given δ s N is given by such a T. If there is a η θ such that

(i) L is θ s ι,
(ii) LS is one of the other κ's, and
(iii) The λ κ is N-μ with LS, then L s N K to L is ?2. If there is a ν ξ such that L is N μ with ξ s ο and LS is N- π with ξ s ρ, then L s N, K to LS, is ?. σ τ-ism
  Suppose, as before, that LS is our N-υ, i.e. that it is φ-ed to be N- χ, its N being one ψ. It obviously isn t by ω-ing LS with some other δ that we ζ LS to be N-χ. According to many (e.g. ϝ, ϟ, ϡ), this ϣ's that, in ϥ-ing LS to be N-χ, we are simply ϧ-ing a ϩ, not ϫ-ing a ϭ. Their ϯ:


(ϰ) Since LS is our N-υ, there isn t some other δ ϱ such that LS s ϲ-ing a given N, or its being N-χ, was β-ed by ω-ing LS with ϱ. Given that N is ϳ N, there is no other ϴ to β that LS is N-χ or that it has a given N. Therefore, in ϥ-ing LS as a N-υ, we are simply ϧ-ing a ϩ: we are not ϵ-ing a ϭ about LS s N. Therefore, the ϶  LS is one ψ ϸ  merely Ϲ's a ϩ; it doesn t ϻ's a ϭ. The same is therefore ϼ of  LS is N-χ (i.e. there is some N l----in this Ͻ one ψ---- such that, at any given Ͻ LS s N is l). For ϯ s Ͽ, suppose that ϰ is ͻ and that it cannot ͼ be on the ͽ of ζ-n ϭ's about LS s N that we ϥ LS to be our N-υ. In that Ͻ, given any δ L!, L! has just as Ͼ Ϳ as LS to be ϥ-en as a N-υ. L! can be an ʹ, a ʹ-΄-ed ͺ, a ΅ in a ·-ing ¸----ΐ at all. So far as there is any ΰ to ϥ LS as a N-υ, and thus as N-χ, those ΰ's are of a ΅΅ ΅΅΅ Ί. It may be that, by ϥ-ing LS as N-χ and ΐΐ (ʹ-΄-ed ͺ) L! as N-ΐΐΐ, the ΐΐΐΐ-ing ΐΐΐΐΐ of ΐΐΐΐΐΐ is ΐΐΐΐΐΐΐ ΐΐΐΐΐΐΐΐ; and it may be that if we ϥ L! as N-χ and thus ΐΐ LS as N-ΐΐΐ, the ΐΐΐΐ-ing ΐΐΐΐΐ of ΐΐΐΐΐΐ is ΐΐΐΐΐΐΐΐΐ ΐΐΐΐΐΐΐΐΐΐ. If so, it doesn t ΐΐΐΐΐΐΐΐΐΐΐ that the first ΐΐΐΐΐ of ΐΐΐΐΐΐ is more ΐΐΐΐΐΐΐΐΐΐΐΐ than the second.

[9] Which, incidentally, is not the case, since there are F's who have a G whereby they cannot feel H. Such F's, unfortunately, do not live long, since they constantly suffer J's without K-ing it and therefore without L-ing anything about it. [10] M of N is not a O that P's ever use. But in this Q it is R to

use it. [11] The O S-ing T U is due to Imre Lakatos, a V of W X who did Y Z in the AA of BB. [12] CC-ed by Carl Hempel; DD-ed in his EE FF's of GG, which was HH-ed in II's of JJ KK. [13] LL: MM may be an NN, e.g. a OO PP; an NN-QQ, e.g. the RR of PP's; an SS, e.g. a TT of UU; an SS-QQ, e.g. the RR of TT's of UU; a VV, e.g. a WW o f a OO XX; or a VV-QQ, e.g. the RR of WW's of a OO XX. [14] LL about the O YY to the ZZ AAA": Some BBB s are not the ZZ AAA CCC. Some BBB s are DDD EEE AAA's. But any FFF BBB is GGG-ed by its HHH's to be the ZZ CCC AAA. So BBB is not an III O: in JJJ-ing an KKK as an BBB, nothing is being LLL-ed as to whether it does in MMM NNN the OOO's PPP-ed by some QQQ-RRR; what is being LLL-ed only that, in somebody s SSS, it does so. [15] See Freud (1914), Totem and Taboo. Freud s TTT: UUU's and otherwise VVV F's WWW the XXX YYY of their ZZZ's onto AAAA, and they consequently believe that the XXX BBBB's that CCCC among their DDDD EEEE's of FFFF's CCCC among those FFFF's themselves. For this GGGG, they believe that, if they HHHH it, it will IIII: hence the JJJJ in the KKKK of LLLL (Freud s MMMM). Freud s TTT is not that F's are NNNN to OOOO a XXX PPPP to AAAA, but that they are NNNN to OOOO the XXX PPPP of their own QQQQ's to AAAA. Freud believes that there are RRRR's of SSSS, etc. But he also believes that the RRRR's of TTTT are not the RRRR's of SSSS and, further, that F's---all F's, at some UUUU of another---have yet to VVVV this WWWW. Hume also believes that F's XXXX-ly WWW the YYYY-XXX YYY onto ZZZZ AAAA. But Hume believes, in AAAAA, that the ZZZZ BBBBB is CCCCC-ly DDDDD-ed: there is no ZZZZ XXX YYY. So for Hume, the EEEEE is that F's are FFFFF-ing any XXX PPPP to the ZZZZ BBBBB, whereas, for Freud, it is that F's are FFFFF-ing a XXX YYY to ZZZZ BBBBB that is GGGGG from the one that it actually has. Hume s TTT is HHHHH. If Hume believes in YYYY IIIII---that is, if he believes that, in the JJJJJ KKKKK, IIIII?LLLLL---then Hume is ipso facto NNNN to MMMMM that in NNNNN IIIII=LLLLL, and his JJJJ that, in the ZZZZ BBBBB, IIIII=LLLLL is OOOOO with his JJJJ that, in other PPPPP's, IIIII?LLLLL. [16] Either as QQQQQ and RRRRR or as SSSSS RRRRR's/QQQQQ's of some one RRRRR. [17] Even if this isn t TTTTT of the UUUUU VVVVV-ing WWWWW to WWWWW*, it is TTTTT of other such UUUUU's. Plus, it is XXXXX-ly HHHHH, by (not so YYYYY) ZZZZZ's of the AAAAA's already BBBBB-ed, to CCCCC

it not TTTTT of that DDDDD UUUUU; and we therefore might as well CCCCC it TTTTT of that DDDDD UUUUU. [18]

Sometimes they turn out to be EEEEE in FFFFF. But how do we GGGGG that there are any

HHHHH's of BBB s such that, when we were IIIII-ing forth those BBB s, we had JJJJJ KKKKK for L-ing so? According to Karl Popper: We don t. We never have any JJJJJ KKKKK to IIIII forth this as LLLLL to AAA. All we can do is IIIII forth an AAA and then MMMMM it doesn t turn out to be NNNNN. [19] Russell (1928, 1948) OOOOO's PPPPP for Q-ing and QQQQQ-ing this RRRRR, using this SSSSS TTTTT. [20] If neither has any UUUUU VVVVV's---if, for WWWWW, they are both XXXXX then they don t differ in their UUUUU VVVVV's. [21] But don t P's use YYYYY's? Don t they perform ZZZZZ's? Yes. But the AAAAAA's used by a BB do not necessarily fall within the BBBBBB of that BB. CCCCCC's DDDDDD EEEEEE's; to do so, they use FFFFFF GGGGGG's; but they don t DDDDDD FFFFFF GGGGGG's. FFFFFF GGGGGG's fall within the HHHHHH of IIIIII, not JJJJJJ. [22] This KKKKKK is LLLLLL-ed from Hempel (1953). [23] MMMMMM (as Russell NNNNNN's out in The OOOOOO of PPPPPP) is not really a QQQQQQ of RRRRRR SSSSSS's, but of TTTTTT UUUUUU's.
